                When you hold MKR or SKY—sealed or unsealed, you also hold the right to participate in Sky
                ecosystem governance voting. This means that you have the ability to contribute to the
                decentralised ecosystem decision-making process through onchain voting.

                The delegation of voting power through the Seal Engine of the Sky Protocol enables you to

                in the Sky ecosystem governance process on your behalf. Delegates in receipt of voting power
                can never directly access any tokens delegated to them, including sealed tokens. You always
                own and are in control of your sealed tokens, and you can change your delegate at any time.

                When you supply MKR or SKY to the Seal Engine, a position is created and those tokens are
                sealed behind an exit fee. You can seal and unseal your tokens anytime.

                Unsealing requires payment of an exit fee —a percentage of the total amount of tokens that you
                have sealed in that position. The fee is automatically subtracted from that total amount, and
                then burnt, removing the tokens from circulation. Your accumulated rewards, which take the
                form of USDS, are not affected by this process. In other words, you do not have to pay an exit
                fee to claim your rewards.{' '}

                The exit fee is a risk parameter managed and determined, regardless of the duration of a
                position, by Sky ecosystem governance. The exit fee applies at unsealing, and the total amount
                is determined at the moment you unseal your MKR or SKY. The moment the Seal Engine launched,
                the exit fee rate was set to 5% of the value of the MKR or SKY tokens that a user has sealed,
                with a planned 1% increase every 6 months thereafter until it reaches the long-term fee rate
                of 15%.
