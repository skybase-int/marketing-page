    question: 'Why should I upgrade my MKR to SKY?',
    answer: `The governance-aligned vote to upgrade MKR to SKY, establishing SKY as the sole governance token of the Sky Protocol, reflects the community's desire to streamline governance, increase voter participation, and support the ecosystem's long-term growth and scalability. Simply put, SKY is the technical and functional evolution of MKR, inheriting the governance functionalities previously held by MKR. 

SKY holders can use the token to vote directly on Sky Ecosystem Governance proposals and/or to transfer the voting power of their SKY tokens to a recognized delegate or a contract that they own, just as they once could with MKR. SKY also enables users to access Staking Rewards via the Sky.money web app. When users supply SKY to the Staking Engine of the Sky Protocol, they can access those rewards and choose to create one or more positions, including positions that enable them to generate and borrow USDS against their supplied SKY, and to delegate the voting power their supplied SKY tokens provide.

    question: 'What is the Delayed Upgrade Penalty?',
    answer: `The Delayed Upgrade Penalty is a time-based upgrade mechanism, approved by Sky Ecosystem Governance, which is designed to facilitate a smooth and prompt upgrade of MKR to SKY.

The penalty, which will begin September 18, 2025, reduces the amount of SKY received per MKR upgraded at a rate of 1%, and increases by 1% every three months thereafter until it reaches 100% in 25 years. The penalty will not apply to anyone upgrading their MKR to SKY before it kicks in.

How the Delayed Upgrade Penalty works
Here are some examples:

- If a user upgrades 1 MKR before the Delayed Upgrade Penalty takes effect, the user will not pay a penalty and will receive 24,000 SKY.

- If a user upgrades 1 MKR three months after the Delayed Upgrade Penalty takes effect, the penalty applies at 1%. So, the amount the user will receive as a result of the upgrade will be 23,760 SKY (24,000 minus 1%).  

- If a user upgrades 1 MKR six months after the Delayed Upgrade Penalty takes effect, the penalty applies at 2%, meaning the user will receive 23,520 SKY (24,000 minus 2%).

Please note that blockchain, or gas, fees for using the Ethereum network apply when upgrading. Blockchain transaction fees are neither controlled, imposed nor received by Sky.money or the Sky Protocol.

    question: 'Why did Sky Ecosystem Governance vote to upgrade MKR to SKY?',
    answer: `The rebrand of MakerDAO to the Sky Ecosystem in September 2024 took the former Maker Protocol to the next level, introducing new technology and features, including an advanced stablecoin, USDS, the upgraded version of DAI. These improvements have vastly enriched user experiences and enhanced network resilience—without compromising the protocol's decentralized and non-custodial design. The governance-aligned vote to upgrade MKR to SKY, establishing SKY as the sole governance token of the Sky Protocol, reflects the community's desire to streamline governance, increase voter participation, and support the ecosystem's long-term growth and scalability.

SKY inherits governance functionality
The upgrade of MKR to SKY establishes SKY as the technical and functional evolution of MKR, inheriting the governance functionalities previously held by MKR. The upgrade is at the rate of 1:24,000 (1 MKR = 24,000 SKY).

SKY holders can use the token to vote directly on Sky Ecosystem Governance proposals and/or to transfer their voting power to a recognized delegate or a contract that they own, just as they once could with MKR.

SKY also enables users to access Staking Rewards via the Sky.money web app. When users supply SKY to the Staking Engine of the Sky Protocol, they can access those rewards and choose to create one or more positions, including positions that enable them to generate and borrow USDS against their supplied SKY, and to delegate the voting power their supplied SKY tokens provide.

Why upgrade
All MKR holders are encouraged to upgrade to SKY promptly to maintain the ability to participate in key decisions shaping the Sky Protocol. Upgrading in a timely fashion ensures reduced governance complexity and a more effective, efficient and resilient ecosystem for all. Please note that while MKR will continue to exist, users will not be able to revert back to MKR from SKY via the Sky Protocol.

To facilitate a smooth and prompt transition, Sky Ecosystem Governance voted to introduce a Delayed Upgrade Penalty. The penalty, which will begin September 18, 2025, reduces the amount of SKY received per MKR upgraded at a rate of 1%, and increases by 1% every three months thereafter until it reaches 100% in 25 years. The penalty will not apply to anyone upgrading their MKR to SKY before it kicks in.

If a user upgrades 1 MKR six months after the Delayed Upgrade Penalty takes effect, the penalty applies at 2%, meaning the user will receive 23,520 SKY (24,000 minus 2%).

The SKY accrued in the Sky Protocol as a result of the Delayed Upgrade Penalty is held in the Converter contract and controlled by Sky Ecosystem Governance.

Voting with SKY
SKY is the sole governance token of the Sky Ecosystem and the upgrade of MKR. SKY token holders can use their SKY to participate directly in Sky Ecosystem Governance through a system of decentralized onchain voting, and/or to entrust their voting power to one or more governance delegates or a contract that they own. Voting with MKR is no longer possible.

Direct Voting with SKY
SKY holders participate directly in Sky Ecosystem Governance by supplying SKY to the Governance Contract of the Sky Protocol via the Sky Governance Voting Portal. Direct voting is weighted, meaning that voting power is proportional to the number of SKY tokens voters supply to that contract. For example, if 50 voters supply a total of 600 SKY in favor of proposal A, while 100 voters supply a total of 400 SKY in support of proposal B, then Proposal A would win with 60% of the vote. The number of people who voted for a proposal is irrelevant; rather, the combined power of SKY tokens behind a proposal decides the winner.

Delegating with SKY
SKY holders can use their tokens to entrust their voting power to one or more delegates via the Sky Governance Voting portal or the Staking Engine of the Sky Protocol. Sky Ecosystem Governance delegates are chosen and approved by governance vote. Creating a new delegate account can only be done via the Sky Governance Voting Portal.

Delegates in receipt of token voting power can never directly access any SKY tokens delegated to them. Throughout the delegation process, users always own and are in control of their SKY tokens and can change their delegate(s) at any time (subject to the Sky Protocol's rules that prevent double voting or misuse of delegated voting power). Delegating voting power may be a useful option for SKY token holders who have limited time to allocate to the process and who want to save on the cost of gas involved in voting on their own.

Staking SKY
When you supply SKY tokens to the Staking Engine using the Sky.money web app, you can access Staking Rewards and choose to create one or more positions, including positions that enable you to generate and borrow USDS against your supplied SKY and to delegate the voting power your SKY tokens provide. Here's a brief overview:

Access Rewards. Supply SKY tokens to access Staking Rewards, initially in the form of USDS. Staking Reward rates are determined by Sky Ecosystem Governance through the process of decentralized onchain voting.

Borrow. Borrow USDS against your supplied SKY. You can exit your borrow position at any time and withdraw or pay back USDS whenever you would like. The USDS Borrow Rate and Debt Ceiling are determined by Sky Ecosystem Governance through the process of decentralized onchain voting. Your total debt increases each block according to the Borrow Rate.

Delegate. Transfer the voting power of your supplied SKY tokens to a recognized delegate or a contract that you own. Your chosen delegate can then participate in the Sky Ecosystem Governance voting process on your behalf. You can choose one delegate per position, meaning if you want to entrust your SKY to two different delegates using the Staking Engine, you will need to create two separate positions.

You may exit your Staking positions at any time; no exit fee applies. The Staking Reward rate and Borrow rate are determined by Sky Ecosystem Governance through the process of decentralized onchain voting.

Your SKY, as well as any Staking Rewards that you accumulate, is supplied to a non-custodial smart contract, such that no intermediary ever takes custody of those tokens. With Sky, you always remain in control of your assets.`,

Verify sources
Always make sure you are accessing the correct URLs. Beware of fake sites with barely noticeable typos in the address.

Cross-check the Sky.money website and the Sky.money web app information and details with official Sky social media accounts (i.e., X, Sky Discord, Sky Builder Discord and the Sky Forum).

Be suspicious of DMs on social media sites. Scammers have been known to impersonate project team members.

Verify related smart contracts
Check the upgrade smart contracts in the Developer Documentation. Legitimate projects make their contracts public.
Look up the contract on the appropriate network block explorer (e.g., Etherscan) to verify its authenticity.

Beware of fake promotions, airdrops and bonus offers
Scammers sometimes advertise fake contests, airdrops or extra tokens as a bonus. Stay alert.

Use a hardware wallet for added security
If possible, use a hardware wallet to interact with smart contracts.
Never share your private key or seed phrase.
Review transaction details carefully before signing. Scam apps may succeed in draining wallets instead of swapping tokens.

Test transactions
Before transacting using a large number of tokens, test the process with a small amount first. If something looks suspicious (e.g., unexpected approval requests), stop and verify before proceeding.`,

    question: 'What is a trade?',
    answer: `A trade is the direct exchange of one cryptocurrency token for another. Trading can occur on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and centralized exchanges (CEXs).

A decentralized exchange (DEX) is a peer-to-peer marketplace made up of smart contracts where users can buy, sell and trade cryptocurrencies without having to share any personal information. No financial institution or third party is needed to facilitate DEX transactions. DEX users interact with smart contracts using crypto wallets. Because no bank or financial institution is involved in facilitating DEX transactions, a DEX can't be used to trade fiat currency for cryptocurrency (or vice versa).

Not all DEXs operate in the same way. To buy crypto on a specific DEX may require knowledge of that DEXs functions and/or underlying code base.

A centralized exchange (CEX) is a marketplace where users create an account by providing identifying information and documentation to a centralized entity in order to buy, sell and trade cryptocurrencies. Importantly, a CEX facilitates exchanges, meaning it acts as an intermediary between buyers and sellers. Some CEXs also require users to opt-in to one or more custodial wallets rather than use a private, non-custodial wallet. With a custodial wallet, the centralized entity, not the user, is in control of safeguarding assets and the wallet's private keys. In that sense, when using a CEX, users trade privacy for simplicity. Users can, however, transfer their assets from a custodial wallet to their own non-custodial wallet if they wish to do so.

Generally, CEXs operate in similar ways, but to learn how to use a specific CEX, obtain information from the exchange directly. Your use of any centralized exchange will likely be subject to that exchange's terms of service and applicable regulatory requirements.`,

For example, eligible users can access the Sky.money web app to trade SKY tokens on Ethereum Mainnet via an API integration with the third-party decentralized exchange (DEX) CoW Swap. Users can trade USDC, USDT, ETH or SKY for USDS, and USDC, USDT, ETH and USDS for SKY. These trades occur through smart contracts on the blockchain without relying on centralized entities. The exact trade route is determined by CoW Swap and is not influenced by Sky.money or the Sky Protocol. Some Sky Protocol features are not available in certain countries for regulatory compliance purposes. USDS and SKY are native Sky Protocol tokens. Please see the Terms of Use for more information on third-party services.

Note that crypto price slippage—a change in the expected price of the asset(s) between the time of the trade order and its execution on the blockchain—can occur due to market volatility and low liquidity environments. When you trade via the Sky Protocol, you can set your slippage tolerance level to limit the amount of order slippage. Users who wish to trade on DEXs should be especially aware of MEV risk, front-running risk and token value risk.`,

    question: `Why aren't all trading pairs available on the Sky.money web app?`,
    answer: `There are several key technical and practical reasons why some DeFi apps, including the Sky.money web app, don't support all cryptocurrencies. For example, each token would need to be specifically integrated into the Sky Protocol's smart contracts, which would require development work and security auditing. Regulatory risk is also a key consideration.

Note, however, that Sky.money web app users can trade a wide range of assets on Ethereum Mainnet through the CoW Swap integration. The Sky Protocol does not limit the assets available for trading via CoW Swap, as it is an independent, third-party decentralized exchange (DEX) that Sky does not control. Please see the Terms of Use for more information on third-party services.`,

    question: 'Is trading using Sky.money free?',
    answer: `Accessing the Sky.money web app is free. Trading, however, may involve a fee imposed by the third-party decentralized exchange (i.e., CoW Swap) integrated with the non-custodial Sky Protocol that is used to make the trade. In addition, you will likely pay a blockchain network transaction fee called a gas fee, which is neither controlled, imposed nor received by Sky.money or the Sky Protocol. This fee is calculated based on current Ethereum network demand and the amount of gas required to process your transaction.

If you have shied away from the Ethereum blockchain due to the high price of gas, the Sky Protocol's SkyLink system enables users to move their Ethereum Mainnet-based Sky assets between supported L2 networks, including Base, with reduced fees and faster transaction speeds.

Sky.money is not responsible for any loss or damages incurred while using such third-party platforms. Please see the Terms of Use for more information on third-party services.`,
