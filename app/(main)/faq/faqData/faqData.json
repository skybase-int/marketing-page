        "question": "What is cryptocurrency?",
        "answer": "Cryptocurrency, also referred to as \"crypto,\" is a type of digital currency that uses cryptography to help improve the security and overall user control of associated transactions. Cryptography is like a secret code that embraces user pseudonymity while ensuring authentic and irreversible transactions.\n\nThere are thousands of cryptocurrencies in circulation, and they vary in purpose, functionality and value. In fact, many experience price volatility over very short periods of time. However, certain cryptocurrencies called stablecoins generally fluctuate to lesser degrees, as they are designed to attempt to maintain a stable value.\n\nStablecoins are typically pegged or soft-pegged to the value of a fiat, or government-issued, currency, such as the U.S. dollar or the euro, and are backed either by fiat currencies, commodities (real-world assets) or other cryptocurrencies held in reserves, the presence of which is intended to make them more stable mediums of exchange.\n\nFor more details on this and other risks associated with cryptocurrencies, please review the [User Risk Documentation](https://docs.sky.money/user-risks)."

        "question": "How is cryptocurrency used?",
        "answer": "There are thousands of cryptocurrencies in circulation, and they vary in purpose, functionality and value. Here are some ways in which they are used:\n\n• **Trading.** Users can buy, sell and trade crypto using a centralized exchange (CEX), which acts as a trusted middleman and requires users to verify their identity, or a decentralized exchange (DEX), which allows users to trade directly from their own crypto wallets without sharing personal information.\n\n• **Peer-to-peer, cross-border transfers.** Users can send crypto directly to anyone, anywhere, using networks powered by blockchain technology.\n\n• **Gaming.** Stablecoins are sometimes used in crypto's video game ecosystem to transact and as rewards, enabling user adoption to grow organically with engagement.\n\n• **Accessing Stability.** Cryptocurrencies called stablecoins generally fluctuate to lesser degrees than other types of crypto, as they are designed to attempt to maintain a stable value. Stablecoins are typically pegged or soft-pegged to the value of a fiat, or government-issued, currency, such as the U.S. dollar or the euro, and are backed either by fiat currencies, commodities (real-world assets) or other cryptocurrencies held in reserves, the presence of which is intended to make them more stable mediums of exchange.\n\n• **Saving.** Some people use crypto as a way to save. For example, eligible users of Sky.money web app can access the decentralized Sky Protocol to supply USDS stablecoins to the Sky Savings Rate module to access the Sky Savings Rate and accumulate additional USDS over time.\n\n• **Accessing Rewards.** Some people use crypto to access rewards without giving up control of their assets. For example, eligible Sky.money web app users can tap into the Sky Protocol to access Sky Tokens Rewards when they supply USDS to the Sky Token Rewards module. When eligible users supply SKY tokens to the Staking Engine of the Protocol, they can access Staking Rewards.\n\n• **Borrowing.** Some DeFi protocols allow users to borrow stablecoins using their crypto as collateral. Eligible users of the Sky.money web app can borrow USDS against the SKY tokens that they supply to the Staking Engine of the Sky Protocol.\n\n• **Lending.** Some DeFi protocols enable users to supply crypto to a smart contract that acts as a pool from which others can borrow. Those suppliers become liquidity providers, who earn rewards in the form of liquidity pool tokens (LPTs). The LPTs they receive represent their share of assets in the pool or a percentage of fees charged to those accessing the pool tokens."

        "question": "What are the benefits of cryptocurrency?",
        "answer": "There are thousands of cryptocurrencies in circulation, and they vary in purpose, functionality and value. Some of the benefits crypto can offer are:\n\n• **Inclusivity.** People in many regions of the world, regardless of their economic standing, can use crypto to transact freely and to access decentralized financial (DeFi) services that let them retain complete control of their assets.\n\n• **Availability.** Many cryptocurrencies are easily exchanged on an expanding variety of both decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and centralized exchanges (CEXs).\n\n• **Speed and affordability.** Users can transfer crypto across the globe within seconds and at a fraction of the cost of traditional wire services.\n\n• **Transparency.** On public blockchains, such as Ethereum, all transactions and smart contracts are publicly viewable. This helps promote trust and accountability.\n\n• **Privacy without secrecy.** While public blockchains are transparent, they don't reveal your real-world identity in a straightforward manner unless you choose to expose that information. Instead, they reveal your wallet address(es) and transaction history. Please note, however, that your identity can be tied to your wallet address using IP addresses or other information you may not \"choose\" to disclose.\n\n• **Immutability.** Once a transaction is recorded on a blockchain, it cannot be altered, which reinforces the integrity of the transaction data.\n\n• **Security.** The code behind DeFi protocols is often open source, allowing for public visibility and analysis. This transparency _may_ enable vulnerabilities to be identified and addressed by a global community of open source contributors. Over time, publicly available and largely unchanged code _could_ provide additional security assurances. Additionally, some DeFi protocols _may_ undergo audits by reputable firms within the industry, which can contribute to enhanced security, though the extent and effectiveness of such measures may vary.\n\n• **Round-the-clock accessibility.** Blockchains operate 24/7."

        "question": "How do I get cryptocurrency?",
        "answer": "Start your cryptocurrency journey by learning about the various types of crypto and how they work, the underlying technology, associated risks, and any regulations regarding crypto in your region. Taking time to understand these fundamentals and the basics of crypto exchanges will help you make more informed decisions about cryptocurrency.\n\nThere are two main types of crypto exchanges—decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and centralized exchanges (CEXs). A DEX is a peer-to-peer marketplace where users can buy, sell and trade cryptocurrencies directly from their own crypto wallets without having to share identifying information. No financial institution or other third party is needed to facilitate DEX transactions. A CEX is also a marketplace where users buy, sell and trade cryptocurrencies, but the CEX or a third party often facilitates trades, meaning it often acts as a middleman between buyers and sellers. CEXs often require users to create an account and verify their identity.\n\nFor risks associated with cryptocurrencies, please review the [User Risk Documentation](https://docs.sky.money/user-risks)."

      },
      {
        "question": "How is cryptography used with cryptocurrency?",
        "answer": "Cryptography is the practice of encrypting information in an effort to keep it safe and hidden from prying eyes. Without cryptography there would be no cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency wallets work using a pair of cryptographic keys—one public, the other private. Public and private keys are long, unique series of alphanumeric characters used together to encrypt data to help to ensure the authenticity and verifiability of crypto transactions."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is decentralized finance?",
        "answer": "Decentralized finance (DeFi) refers to a sector of the cryptocurrency economy that aims to provide open and permissionless financial applications, products and services built on and accessed via blockchains. The term ‘permissionless' in this context generally means that users do not need permission to join an open blockchain network, and are in complete and direct control of their assets and financial activities. ‘Open' speaks to the complete transparency of public blockchains.\n\nDeFi applications typically aim to enable fast, borderless transactions, via self-executing, autonomous smart contracts, often at a fraction of the cost of traditional wire services, as a result of being disintermediated (in direct control of their activities).\n\nFinally, DeFi offerings are often managed by decentralized ecosystems that operate with the help of rules and agreements embedded in the smart contracts. Smart contracts are programs written in computer code and deployed to a blockchain. Ecosystem projects are controlled not by one person or entity, but by a global community of ecosystem participants, subject to their specific terms and technical limitations."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are dApps?",
        "answer": "Decentralized financial applications (dApps) are typically made up of software code deployed to a blockchain. This code usually takes the form of smart contracts that run automatically and independently. The smart contracts contain the rules and agreements that constitute the framework of the applications, and are what allow for the fast and efficient creation, transfer and validation of digital assets, as well as for decentralized community governance. The decentralized Sky Protocol is a dApp."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is a decentralized exchange?",
        "answer": "A decentralized exchange (DEX) is a peer-to-peer marketplace made up of smart contracts where users can buy, sell and trade cryptocurrencies without having to share any personal information. No financial institution or third party is needed to facilitate DEX transactions.\n\nDEX users interact directly with smart contracts using crypto wallets that are secured by private keys. Because DEXs are non-custodial, users are fully responsible for their own assets. That means if you lose access to your private keys, your assets are irrecuperable. Additionally, because no bank or financial institution is involved in facilitating DEX transactions, a DEX can't be used to trade fiat currency for cryptocurrency (or vice versa).\n\nNot all DEXs operate in the same way. To buy crypto on a specific DEX may require knowledge of that DEXs functions and/or underlying code base."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is a centralized exchange?",
        "answer": "A centralized exchange (CEX) is a marketplace where users create an account by providing identifying information and documentation to a centralized entity in order to buy, sell and trade cryptocurrencies. Importantly, a CEX facilitates exchanges, meaning it acts as an intermediary between buyers and sellers. Some CEXs also require users to opt-in to one or more custodial wallets rather than use a private, non-custodial wallet. With a custodial wallet, the centralized entity, not the user, is in control of safeguarding assets and the wallet's private keys. In that sense, when using a CEX, users trade privacy for simplicity. Users can, however, transfer their assets from a custodial wallet to their own non-custodial wallet if they wish to do so.\n\nCentralized exchanges typically offer customer support through their websites, and may offer some fund recovery options in specific situations. For example, if you lose access to your CEX account but can verify your identity, a process might be employed to help you regain access.\n\nGenerally, CEXs operate in similar ways, but to learn how to use a specific CEX, obtain information from the exchange directly. Your use of any centralized exchange will likely be subject to that exchange's terms of service and applicable regulatory requirements."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the relationship between TVL and token price?",
        "answer": "TVL (Total Value Locked) generally represents the total value of cryptocurrency assets that are supplied to a protocol or reported as the total value locked in a contract representing a protocol's features (e.g., a lending contract or a savings contract).\n\nTVL is commonly measured in fiat currency, typically US dollars, not in a protocol's native token. For example, If a protocol has 100 ETH locked, and one ETH is worth $4,000, then the calculated TVL is $400,000. If the price of ETH falls or rises, the TVL fluctuates accordingly."

      {
        "question": "What are stablecoins, and how do they differ from other types of cryptocurrencies?",
        "answer": "Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that implement various mechanisms in an attempt to maintain a stable value. They are typically pegged or soft-pegged to the value of a fiat (government-issued) currency, such as the U.S. dollar or the euro. Different types of stablecoins may be backed either by fiat currencies, commodities (real-world assets) or other cryptocurrencies held in reserves, though the specific backing mechanisms and their effectiveness can vary significantly. The presence of these backing mechanisms is intended to support price stability, but does not guarantee it.\n\nFor details on the risks associated with stablecoins, please review the [User Risk Documentation](https://docs.sky.money/user-risks)."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the different mechanisms used to maintain the stability of a stablecoin's value.",
        "answer": "Stablecoins are designed to attempt to maintain a stable value. They are typically pegged to the value of a fiat (government-issued) currency, such as the U.S. dollar or the euro. Stablecoins are backed either by fiat currencies, commodities (real-world assets) or other cryptocurrencies held in reserves, the presence of which is intended to make them more stable mediums of exchange. Stablecoins are most often used to make transfers, especially cross-border transfers, using networks powered by blockchain technology.\n\nThere are generally two broad categories of stablecoin structures:\n\n• **Centralized stablecoins.** Centralized stablecoins are typically issued and managed by a centralized entity, such as a regulated financial institution. These entities generally claim to maintain reserves of backing assets.\n\n• **Decentralized stablecoins.** Decentralized stablecoins typically operate through smart contracts and community-driven governance systems, where token holders may participate in decisions about the protocol's operation.\n\nIn order for a stablecoin to maintain its value over time, a method or mechanism that works to demonstrate long-term sustainability is typically employed. The choice of mechanism can depend on whether a stablecoin is centralized or decentralized.\n\nMany stablecoins maintain their value through a process called asset-backed collateralization. These stablecoins aim to maintain reserves of assets intended to back the tokens in circulation. The actual value and composition of these reserves may vary and typically depend on the specific project's implementation.\n\nOften, for stablecoins that are crypto-collateralized, overcollateralization combined with algorithmic methods, in the form of smart contracts, is used. Overcollateralization means that the total value of the collateral that backs a specific stablecoin must always be higher than the total value of every one of those stablecoins in circulation. For example, if a protocol's governance community decides that its stablecoin must be overcollateralized by 20%, and the value of all its stablecoins in circulation is 1M, the collateral held in reserve must be worth at least $1.2M.\n\nOther types of stability mechanisms include the following:\n\n• **Algorithmic:** Algorithmic stablecoins maintain stability using algorithms and smart contracts to automatically adjust their supply based on demand. For example, if the market price of an algorithmic stablecoin is above its target value, a smart contract increases the supply of the stablecoin to decrease its price. If the market price is below its target value, a smart contract decreases the supply of the stablecoin to increase its price.\n\n• **Real-world asset (RWA):** RWA-collateralized stablecoins are backed by tangible, physical assets, including gold, government bonds, real estate and artwork.\n\n• **Hybrid:** Hybrid stablecoins use a mix of methods to maintain stability."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens when the value of the collateral backing a stablecoin falls significantly?",
        "answer": "The collateral that backs a stablecoin is what allows it to be a trusted store of value and stable medium of exchange. If the value of that collateral declines significantly, the stablecoin may become insufficiently backed and drop in value below its peg. Stablecoin values often deviate only marginally from their target price; however, significant market events can lead to larger price movements. Typically, minor fluctuations in the value of collateral do not cause immediate instability. However, in cases of substantial collateral value decline, market participants may react by selling their holdings, which could further impact prices. Moreover, if a de-pegged stablecoin has a high market cap, meaning that a lot of people depend on its stability, the sell-off could cause fear to spread regarding the stability of other stablecoins, and lead to off-loading of stable assets throughout the market."

        "question": "What role do stablecoins play in the DeFI ecosystem?",
        "answer": "Stablecoins provide the foundation on which much of decentralized finance (DeFi) functions, and are essential to increasing DeFi adoption worldwide. They are typically pegged to the value of a fiat (government-issued) currency, such as the U.S. dollar or the euro.\n\nStablecoins are commonly used for:\n\n• **Peer-to-peer, cross-border transfers**. Stablecoin (and other crypto) holders can send their tokens directly to anyone, anywhere, using networks powered by blockchain technology.\n\n• **Trading.** Users can buy, sell and trade crypto using a centralized exchange (CEX), which acts as a trusted middleman and requires users to verify their identity, or a decentralized exchange (DEX), which allows users to trade directly from their own crypto wallets without sharing personal information. Sky Protocol tokens are available to trade on crypto exchanges that list them.\n\n• **Saving.** Some people use crypto as a way to save. For example, eligible users of the Sky.money web app can access the Sky Protocol to supply USDS to the Sky Savings Rate module to access the Sky Savings Rate and accumulate additional USDS over time.\n\n• **Borrowing.** Some DeFi protocols allow users to borrow stablecoins using their crypto as collateral. Eligible users of the Sky.money web app can borrow USDS against SKY that they supply to the Staking Engine of the Sky Protocol.\n\n• **Lending.** Some DeFi protocols enable users to supply crypto to a smart contract that acts as a pool from which others can borrow. Those crypto suppliers become liquidity providers, who access rewards in the form of liquidity pool tokens (LPTs). The LPTs they receive represent their share of assets in the pool or a percentage of fees charged to those accessing the pool tokens.\n\n• **Accessing Rewards.** Some people use crypto to access rewards without giving up control of their assets. For example, eligible Sky.money web app users can tap into the Sky Protocol to access Sky Tokens Rewards when they supply USDS to the Sky Token Rewards module. When eligible users supply SKY tokens to the Staking Engine of the Protocol, they can access Staking Rewards.\n\n• **Risk management**. Stablecoins may offer a safe haven during market turbulence, allowing traders to quickly exit volatile positions without leaving the crypto ecosystem.\n\n• **Cross-project integration**: Stablecoins enable seamless value transfer between different DeFi protocols and applications, creating interoperability across the ecosystem.\n\nStablecoins typically enable DeFi growth by:\n\n• **Reducing barriers to entry for Traditional Finance (TradFi) users**: The fact that decentralized stablecoins are soft-pegged to the U. S. dollar makes it easier for newcomers to understand and use DeFi without first mastering cryptocurrency price dynamics.\n\n• **Enabling complex financial products and strategies**: The stable value of stablecoins allows for the creation of predictable derivatives, synthetic assets and structured products.\n\n• **Supporting the growth of decentralized lending markets**: Stablecoins provide the stable foundation needed for lending protocols to perhaps offer reliable savings rates and borrowing terms.\n\n• **Facilitating price stability in exchanges**: Stablecoins reduce overall market volatility and improve price discovery mechanisms in exchanges.\n\n• **Creating bridges between TradFi and DeFi**: Stablecoins can serve as a familiar entry and exit point between the traditional financial system and decentralized applications.\n\nWith the Sky.money web app, you always remain in control of your assets. You alone are responsible for managing your private keys and digital wallet access."

        "question": "What is the difference between a centralized and decentralized stablecoin?",
        "answer": "A centralized stablecoin, like USDC, is one that is issued and managed by a centralized entity, such as a bank or FinTech company. A decentralized stablecoin, such as USDS, is not issued or controlled by a centralized entity. Instead, a community of users participate in a transparent, decentralized system of governance that can influence how the underlying protocol is generated and managed, subject to the protocol's technical parameters and limitations."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are crypto-collateralized stablecoins, and how do they achieve stability?",
        "answer": "A crypto-collateralized stablecoin is a type of decentralized digital currency that is typically soft-pegged to the value of a fiat currency, such as the U.S. dollar, and backed (collateralized) by other cryptocurrencies locked in a reserve or in a smart contract sometimes called a cryptocurrency vault. The stability mechanisms behind crypto-collateralized stablecoins generally include overcollateralization and algorithmic methods, though these mechanisms do not guarantee a stable value. Three examples of crypto collateral that back USDS are ETH, wBTC and USDC."

        "question": "What is an example of a crypto-collateralized stablecoin?",
        "answer": "A crypto-collateralized stablecoin is a type of decentralized digital currency that is typically soft-pegged to the value of a fiat currency, such as the U.S. dollar, and backed (collateralized) by other cryptocurrencies locked in a reserve or in a smart contract, which may sometimes be referred to as a cryptocurrency vault.\n\nTo maintain stability of crypto-collateralized stablecoins, algorithms and overcollateralization are probably the most widely used mechanisms. Examples of crypto-collateralized stablecoins are USDS and DAI. USDS powers the Sky Ecosystem."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between a stablecoin that's pegged to the U.S. dollar and one that's soft-pegged to the U.S. dollar?",
        "answer": "The difference between a stablecoin that is pegged to the U.S. dollar and one that is soft-pegged to the U.S. dollar lies primarily in the degree of adherence to the peg and the mechanisms used to maintain that peg.\n\nA stablecoin that is pegged, or ‘hard-pegged,' to the U.S. dollar maintains a strict 1:1 value ratio with the dollar. This means that for every 1 stablecoin in circulation, there is 1 actual U.S. dollar (or equivalent) held in reserve by the stablecoin creator.\n\nA stablecoin that is soft-pegged to the U.S. dollar aims to stay close to $1 in value, but doesn't guarantee a strict 1:1 value ratio with the dollar. Instead of being backed by dollars in reserve, the stablecoin is backed by collateral, such as crypto assets, or depends on other mechanisms to maintain its price. The value of a soft-pegged stablecoin can fluctuate based on market conditions.\n\nBoth types of stablecoins strive to offer stability, but the degree of price stability and the mechanisms employed to achieve it can differ significantly."

      {
        "question": "What is a blockchain?",
        "answer": "Crypto transactions occur on networks (blockchains) powered by blockchain technology, which transcend borders. A permissionless blockchain is a distributed ledger (list of transactions) that anyone can view and verify. In contrast, permissioned or private blockchains exist where transactions are not publicly visible to everyone. These blockchains are typically used by enterprises, governments, and organizations that require privacy. There are also privacy-enhanced blockchains, whereby transactions are encrypted or use advanced cryptographic techniques to hide details.\n\nGenerally, blockchain transactions are immutable, meaning that once executed, they are typically irreversible. While Bitcoin and Ethereum are among the most well known blockchain networks, there are many others.\n\nThere are generally two types of blockchains—public and private. Private blockchains, also called \"trusted\" or \"permissioned\" blockchains, are typically designed to meet the specific needs of a project or organization; therefore, they are closed to all but authorized users. Public blockchains are just that—open and accessible by all.\n\nLike traditional accounting ledgers, blockchain networks keep a record of transactions; unlike traditional ledgers, permissionless blockchain networks are open, meaning that anyone, anywhere can view blockchain public transactions at any time by using a blockchain explorer. Blockchain explorers are pieces of software that allow anyone to see blockchain data and activity that is public. Etherscan is the public blockchain explorer for the Ethereum network."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is blockchain data verification?",
        "answer": "Data verification is crucial to a blockchain network, as it confirms that all transactions added to the blockchain are valid. Verification prevents double-spending, helping to ensure the integrity of a chain.\n\nBlockchain data is verified using a network of stakeholders called nodes, miners or validators. At the risk of oversimplifying a complicated process, nodes make sure that if you want to send $5 worth of a specific cryptocurrency to someone, you actually have $5 worth of that crypto in your possession. They also make sure that you follow the rules of the blockchain and don't attempt to spend that $5 more than once (i.e., the prevention of a concept referred to as \"double-spend\"). In addition to making sure all transaction data is processed properly, nodes all have exact copies of the blockchain, which enables them to maintain all blockchain data synchronously (at the same time).\n\nNote that both public and private blockchain networks use nodes to verify transactions; however, with private blockchains, the nodes are permissioned nodes that are authorized/pre-approved by the entity running the permissioned chain to participate in verifying the transactions."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is a blockchain transaction (gas) fee?",
        "answer": "Every time you engage in transactions with your digital assets (e.g., buy, sell, trade or transfer them) you will likely pay a transaction fee—called a gas fee—for using the blockchain network. That fee is calculated based on current network demand and the amount of gas (i.e., units of compute resources) required to process your transaction."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the characteristics of public blockchain networks?",
        "answer": "Blockchain networks are decentralized accounting ledgers, of which there are two types—public and private. Private blockchains, also called \"trusted\" or \"permissioned\" blockchains, are designed to meet the specific needs of a project or organization, therefore they are closed to all but authorised users. Public blockchains are just that—open and accessible by all, meaning that anyone, anywhere can view the blockchain transactions at any time by using a blockchain explorer. Etherscan is the blockchain explorer for the Ethereum network.\n\nThe unique characteristics of public blockchains are as follows:\n\n• **Accessibility.** Anyone with internet access can participate in a public blockchain network, 24-7.\n\n• **Decentralization.** Public blockchains are decentralized. No single entity controls public networks, which helps to reduce—not eliminate—the risk of fraud or manipulation.\n\n• **Speed and affordability.** The lack of an intermediary in public blockchains increases transaction speed and reduces cost.\n\n• **Mechanization.** Smart contracts—programmed functionalities written in computer code—self-execute, enabling the automation of complex financial transactions and operations.\n\n• **Security.** Data is stored across a network of computers, making information difficult to tamper with.\n\n• **Transparency.** All transactions on permissionless blockchains are visible to the public; therefore, anyone in any region with an internet connection can track blockchain activity.\n\n• **Trustlessness.** Decentralized blockchain technology ensures that all transactions are accurate, without having to put trust in a centralized third party to verify their accuracy.\n\n• **Immutability.** Generally, blockchain transactions are immutable, meaning that once executed, they are irreversible.\n\n• **Ingenuity.** In the same way blockchain networks have opened the door to decentralized finance (DeFi) they can open the door to apps and services not yet conceived.\n\nDue to the characteristics listed above, blockchain networks may allow for worldwide coordination and collaboration without intermediaries. They add an ownership layer to the internet, which not only enables peer-to-peer finance, but also allows for communities to coordinate and self-manage through ecosystem governance processes using smart contracts and onchain incentives."

      {
        "question": "What is a blockchain bridge?",
        "answer": "A blockchain bridge is a protocol or platform that allows users to transact data and digital assets between different blockchains.\n\nFor example, if you have USDS, a native stablecoin of the Sky Protocol, which is built on the Ethereum blockchain, and you want to use it on another blockchain, you might use a bridge to make that transfer. The bridge infrastructure connects the two blockchains, handling the ‘messaging' that tells the destination chain that the USDS tokens are locked in a smart contract on Ethereum, and it's safe to generate the equivalent amount. Importantly, whether you receive a native version of USDS on the destination chain or an equivalent amount of a wrapped version depends on the destination chain's implementation."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are smart contracts?",
        "answer": "Smart contracts are agreements written in computer code and deployed to a blockchain, where they self-execute automatically when called upon. No centralized entity or intermediary is needed to complete the steps laid out in those agreements. Smart contacts are key to the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, as they are used to execute everything from simple transfers and trades to the governance of decentralized ecosystems in a peer-to-peer or peer-to-contract manner.\n\nSmart contracts work a lot like vending machines. A vending machine automatically provides a product once you feed it a coin and choose the product you want. The machine does not call someone at the vending machine company to get permission or further instructions. Similarly, a smart contract automatically provides a specific output (O) when prompted by a specific input (I). For example, a smart contract deployed to serve an ecosystem can send money to contractors (O) on the first of every month (I), without any help or interference from a payroll manager, bank or other financial institution.\n\nMost smart contracts are open source (transparent) and immutable in theory, meaning no one can change them once they're deployed. In DeFi ecosystems, including the Sky Ecosystem, smart contract changes can only be made through a system of decentralized community governance and onchain voting processes."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are smart contracts secure?",
        "answer": "Smart contracts are agreements written in computer code and deployed to a blockchain, where they self-execute automatically when called upon. No centralized entity or intermediary is needed to complete the steps laid out in those agreements. Smart contacts must be written correctly in order to work as expected. If there's a coding error in a smart contract, it might not perform as it should. Any vulnerabilities in a smart contract could cause security issues. Even meticulously written smart contracts can have vulnerabilities, which can manifest through complex interactions and economic attack vectors. For example, hackers might find errors and use them to their advantage, causing harm to users. Smart contract audits can help mitigate risks caused by developer error.\n\nFor details on the risks associated with smart contracts, please review the [User Risk Documentation](https://docs.sky.money/user-risks)."

        "question": "What is a cryptocurrency wallet, and how do I get one?",
        "answer": "A crypto wallet is a tool, typically in the form of software, that enables you to easily view a list of your digital assets, manage them, and help safeguard them. Note that with crypto wallets, your assets are recorded on a blockchain and only visible in the wallet—not stored there.\n\nYour non-custodial wallet holds the private keys needed to sign crypto transactions, and gives you full control over those private keys, which are essential for accessing and managing your crypto. Unlike custodial wallets, where a third party holds the private keys, non-custodial wallets allow users to be the sole custodian of their keys. This means that only the user has the ability to sign transactions, making it more secure and private; however, it also means that if a user loses their private key or recovery phrase, they may permanently lose access to their assets. Because all crypto assets exist on a public or private blockchain, access to them depends on control of the corresponding private keys.\n\nNon-custodial wallets can be software-based, like mobile apps, or hardware devices designed for enhanced security. There are several types of crypto wallets and no limit to the number of wallets you can own. Two popular software-based wallets are Metamask and Rainbow."

These keys are essential components of what is known as \"public key cryptography,\" the core concept underlying wallet security and actions.\n\nTypically, when setting up a new non-custodial digital wallet, the wallet software generates a \"seed phrase,\" which is a sequence of 12, 18, or 24 seemingly random words used as a mnemonic device to access the underlying private key(s) related to that wallet. The seed phrase can be used to recover the public and private keys, and should therefore be stored somewhere safe and never shared with anyone.\n\nA private key is a randomly generated string of letters and numbers which acts as a sort of password that gives anyone that knows it the capability to control the wallet assets. It is known only to the user and should be kept secure and confidential to ensure that only the user has access to and can control any associated assets. The private key is used to sign transactions. For example, when a user wants to send crypto or access their assets on the blockchain, they would use the private key to authorize the transaction.\n\nA public key is usually derived from the private key using a mathematical algorithm. It is a string of characters that can be shared openly without compromising a wallet's inherent security. The public key is used to generate wallet addresses and to encrypt data. For example, when someone wants to send digital assets to a user, they would use the user's public key or the associated wallet address."

        "question": "How do I use a non-custodial digital wallet to make a transaction?",
        "answer": "Once you've set up your non-custodial digital wallet, and have your public and private keys, you can use it to manage (send and receive) your digital assets on the blockchain. Every time you transact, your wallet requires you to digitally sign the transaction with your private key. Signing when prompted is a simple but critical part of the process, demonstrating that you acknowledge your action, and ensuring that only you have control of your crypto.\n\nSome onchain actions might require multiple wallet signatures to authorize them. For example, to complete a trade on the decentralized, non-custodial Sky Protocol using the Sky.money web app, you would first need to confirm that you allow the app to access the token you want to trade in your wallet (one signature), and then authorize the actual trade (another signature)."

        "question": "Explain the types of crypto wallets",
        "answer": "There are several types of crypto wallets and theoretically no limit to the number of wallets a user can generate. But not all wallets are compatible with all blockchains. Therefore, depending on the cryptocurrencies you hold, you might need to use more than one wallet.\n\nFrom a security perspective, crypto wallets can be classified under two broad categories: hot and cold.\n\nHot wallets are those connected to the internet most of the time (i.e., software-based mobile, desktop, and browser wallets), making it easy to access and use for transactions but also potentially more vulnerable to hacking and cyber threats. Cold wallets include hardware wallets, which are physical appliances that connect to a computer, laptop, or mobile device via a cable or Bluetooth, further enhancing their security against hacking and cyber threats; and paper wallets, which consist simply of a piece of paper on which the public and private keys of a cryptocurrency address or a QR code are written. Cold wallets are completely offline. Each wallet type has specific advantages, so you'll want to do your own research to choose the one that best meets your security and performance needs. SkyWing does not endorse products. For more info, see the [User Risk Documentation](https://docs.sky.money/user-risks).\n\n### **Hot Wallet Types**\n\n• **Mobile wallets.** Mobile wallets— commonly used hot wallets—may present increased security concerns given that a smartphone is almost always connected to the internet and may be susceptible to viruses, loss or theft. With a mobile wallet, your private key is only as secure as your phone.\n\n• **Desktop and browser wallets.** Desktop and browser wallets are accessed on desktop and laptop computers via browser extensions. Importantly, these wallets cannot necessarily be accessed by mobile browsers. While laptops and computers are typically more difficult to steal than mobile phones, they, too, are susceptible to viruses and are only as safe as the device's security system.\n\n### **Cold Wallet Types**\n\n• **Hardware wallets**. Hardware wallets are physical appliances that connect to a computer, laptop, or mobile device via a cable or Bluetooth. The main benefit of hardware wallets is that the seed phrase and private keys are typically never exposed to the internet or the device that's connected to them. Hardware wallets offer improved security because they are only hot when connected to a device. To sign a transaction using a hardware wallet, you must manually unlock your private key by entering a passcode on the device.\n\n• **Paper wallets.** Paper wallets can be secure, as they are invulnerable to online attacks and are never connected to the internet. They simply constitute a piece of paper with a public and private key or QR code printed on it. This being said, paper can be stolen, degrade, fade, or be destroyed if not stored properly.\n\n### **Smart Contract Wallets**\n\nA smart contract wallet, or \"smart wallet,\" is a wallet managed through smart contract code instead of a private key. This enables users to enjoy advanced features, such as multi-signature transactions, daily transfer limits, automation, emergency account freezing, and more secure account recovery. Smart wallets aren't supported by all exchanges or DeFi apps."

        "question": "Explain what a DAO is, and how it works",
        "answer": "A DAO, or Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is a term typically used to describe a group of individuals who collaborate and self-govern in a decentralized way using crypto and blockchain technology, and who often manage their rules and their finances collectively via a set of self-executing processes and collective decision-making. DAOs are community-governed and their members often elect to abide by rules that are voted on and ratified using crypto token-based voting, and then encoded in blockchain-based smart contracts. In other words, a DAO is not managed in a traditional sense by a CEO or president, or any other form of centralized leadership."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of a DAO?",
        "answer": "A decentralized Autonomous Organization, or DAO, is the formal description of a structured group of disparate individuals responsible for a blockchain-based project. DAOs are community-governed and abide by rules that are voted on by consensus, ratified, and then encoded in blockchain-based smart contracts. In other words, a DAO is not managed in a traditional sense or by a CEO or president.\n\n### **The strengths of decentralization**\n\n• **Coordination.** When a group of people make decisions together, many opinions are considered and it prevents a single source of failure. Strong coordination helps to ensure that important things happen quickly and efficiently, especially during emergencies.\n\n• **Transparency.** Data is shared among all in a decentralized organization, providing a high level of transparency. Transparency aids in solving problems and helps to keep everyone honest and communicative, which can reduce the risk of abuse of power.\n\n• **Facilitates Innovation.** When many people are able to share ideas, creativity flows freely. New ideas can be discussed openly and explored—or not. This open environment often allows certain, less popular ideas to be quickly identified and filtered out, while other ideas can gain traction.\n\n• **Higher morale.** While not everyone in a decentralized organization will always feel empowered, motivated and happy, more autonomy and responsibility can often translate to a high level of morale.\n\n### **The weaknesses of decentralization**\n\n• **Distributed control may sacrifice speed.** In decentralized organizations, final decisions could take longer to reach. Even minor changes may require significant discussion and consensus, making them difficult to approve or reject quickly.\n\n• **Complexity.** Just because an organization is decentralized doesn't mean everyone works completely on their own and smoothly. Authority is typically delegated, and there are goals that must be met. This means that, despite decentralization, the organization still requires coordination and accountability, which can be difficult to achieve.\n\n• **Unconventionality.** Decentralized organizations can be hard for newcomers to get used to. For example, an uptick in the number of meetings or communication channels might seem excessive, or the pay structure might be very different from what's offered at centralized organizations."

        "question": "What was Maker, who founded it, and why?",
        "answer": "Maker was co-founded by Rune Christensen and Nikolai Mushegian in late 2014. It was designed to develop an inclusive decentralized financial (DeFi) platform that aims to provide anyone, anywhere with equal access to an empowering global financial marketplace. Maker quickly grew to find success with the development of its native DAI stablecoin. DAI enabled the Maker Protocol to become the first DeFi liquidity protocol with a product-market fit, bringing real value to the DeFi space.\n\nIn 2024, Maker rebranded to the Sky Ecosystem. Through this rebranding effort, Sky has since taken the former decentralized Maker Protocol to the next level with new technology that focuses on resilience and simplicity while remaining non-custodial."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why rebrand MakerDAO to the Sky Ecosystem?",
        "answer": "Maker began in 2014, as a small community-governed project responsible for developing the Maker Protocol on the Ethereum blockchain. Maker quickly grew to find success with the development of its DAI stablecoin. DAI enabled the Maker Protocol to become the first decentralized finance (DeFi) liquidity protocol with a product-market fit. The Maker Protocol grew to such an extent that by 2021, effective governance by its monolithic community proved challenging.\n\nWhile the complexity of Maker had been necessary to pursue the best opportunities in the market, the community felt that there existed scaling issues that ultimately held the project back. The rebrand of Maker to the Sky Ecosystem, in 2024, took the former Maker Protocol to the next level with technology that focuses on resilience and simplicity while remaining decentralized and non-custodial. In short, the Sky Protocol features products and tools, organizational restructuring, and token upgrades — i.e., USDS, the upgraded version of DAI; and SKY, the upgraded version of MKR.\n\nThese advancements have vastly improved user experiences and enhanced network resilience while creating more alignment between product users, governance participants and the ecosystem as a whole."

        "question": "What is the Sky Protocol?",
        "answer": "The Sky Protocol is a decentralized financial application (dApp) developed around its native USDS stablecoin. It is designed to enable the Sky Ecosystem to operate autonomously and allow users to engage with blockchain technology.\n\nThe Sky Protocol is made up of software code deployed to the Ethereum blockchain. The code takes the form of smart contracts that are self-executing, trustless, decentralized and permissionless. These smart contracts contain the rules and agreements that constitute the framework of the Sky Protocol, and are what allow for the fast and efficient creation, transfer and validation of digital assets, as well as for Sky Ecosystem community governance.\n\nSmart contracts work a lot like vending machines. A vending machine automatically provides a product once you feed it a coin and choose the product you want. The machine does not call someone at the vending machine company to get permission or further instructions. Similarly, a smart contract automatically provides a specific output (O) when prompted by a specific input (I). For example, a smart contract deployed to serve an ecosystem can send money to contractors (O) on the first of every month (I), without any help or interference from a payroll manager, bank or other financial institution.\n\nThe Sky Protocol features several tokens— USDS, DAI, sUSDS, SKY and MKR—plus the Sky Savings Rate, Sky Token Rewards, the Staking Engine, SkyLink, and more."

This includes all of the marketing, operations, governance, and functionalities of the non-custodial platform.\n\nSKY, when written in all caps, is the ticker symbol of the native governance token of the Sky Protocol. SKY token holders have the ability to both participate directly in Sky Ecosystem Governance through a system of decentralized onchain voting and to access Staking Rewards via the Staking Engine of the Sky Protocol.\n\nUnderstanding this distinction helps in navigating the ecosystem, whether you are accessing the features of the Sky Protocol, engaging effectively in governance, or both."

      {
        "question": "Explain Peg Stability Modules, how they work, and their advantages?",
        "answer": "Peg Stability Modules (PSMs) are smart contracts that allow users to convert certain stablecoins directly with the Sky Protocol for USDS or DAI at a fixed rate and with relatively low fees. They are designed to maintain the stability of USDS and DAI. Unlike decentralized exchange (DEX) transactions, PSM operations do not involve trading between users. Instead, they are direct, non-custodial conversions (generate and burn) executed with the decentralized smart contracts of the Sky Protocol.\n\nThrough PSMs, USDS or DAI is obtained via predictable-rate conversion (typically a 1:1 ratio with certain stablecoins, or, in the case of sUSDS, for an amount reflecting its current price) rather than through borrowing. For example, given the existence of a USDC-backed PSM, a user could supply 100 USDC stablecoins to generate 100 USDS or 100 DAI (minus fees), without taking on any debt. Given that PSM operations are facilitated on the Sky Protocol directly and not on a DEX, price slippage (i.e., the difference between the expected price of a token and the actual price when traded) is not a concern. Zero Sky protocol fees and no slippage are some of the benefits of using PSM, which adds liquidity to the assets backing the PSM. That liquidity helps to keep the value of USDS and DAI stable.\n\nA PSM can only hold an asset that is pegged to the same asset as DAI or USDS because it offers 1-to-1 conversions. A PSM with a non-stable asset would become undercollateralized as soon as the market price of that non-stable asset decreased.\n\nThe amount of conversions a PSM can offer is limited by its debt ceiling and the total current amount of collateral tokens supplied to it.\n\nFor more information, review the [Peg Stability Modules section](https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/A.3.4.2.1.1_Peg_Stability_Module/1b2f2ff0-8d73-80b4-9ad5-c91127628179%7C57eaaad19a16975d) of the [Sky Atlas](https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/)."

        "question": "What are oracles?",
        "answer": "The decentralized, non-custodial Sky Protocol relies on oracles, which are third-party services that provide offchain price feed data to the blockchain. Oracles support DeFi protocols in a number of ways, and offer users and end users the following:\n\n• **Increased stability:** Reliable price data ensures efficient collateralization of stablecoins and minimises the risk of under-collateralized borrowing, safeguarding pegs.\n\n• **Transparency and decentralization:** The use of multiple independent oracle feeds reduces a protocol's or decentralized exchange's reliance on any single source, promoting transparency and trust in a system.\n\n• **Flexibility and innovation:** The modular design of an oracle system allows for both integration of new data sources and feeds, and separation. In other words, oracles can be on- and off-boarded when needs arise.\n\nSky Core uses oracles provided by [Chronicle](https://chroniclelabs.org/).

        "question": "What is the Sky.money web app, and what can I do with it?",
        "answer": "The non-custodial Sky.money web app is one of many free-to-access frontend gateways to the Sky Protocol, which is designed around the USDS stablecoin. It provides eligible users with access to all Sky Protocol tokens (sUSDS, USDS, DAI, SKY and MKR) and features, including the Sky Savings Rate (SSR), Sky Token Rewards (STRs), the Staking Engine, SkyLink, more.\n\nEligible Sky.money web app users can:\n\n• **Trade.** Sky Protocol tokens are available to trade on crypto exchanges that list them. Eligible users of the Sky.money web app can access the non-custodial Sky Protocol to trade SKY on Ethereum Mainnet and select L2s via an API integration with the third-party decentralized exchange (DEX) [CoW Swap](https://swap.cow.fi/#/1/swap/WETH). Please see the [Terms of Use](https://docs.sky.money/legal-terms) for more information on third-party services.\n\n• **Upgrade.** Upgrading enables you to take advantage of the many Sky Ecosystem features.\n\n  • Upgrade DAI to USDS 1:1, and revert USDS back to DAI 1:1.\n\n  • Upgrade MKR to the SKY token at a rate of 1:24,000 (1 MKR = 24,000 SKY). While MKR will continue to exist, reverting from SKY to MKR via the Sky Protocol is not possible. SKY is the technical and functional evolution of MKR and the sole governance token of the Sky Protocol. SKY inherited the governance functionalities previously held by MKR. For upgrade details and step-by-step upgrade instructions, please visit the [MKR to SKY Upgrade Hub](https://upgrademkrtosky.sky.money).\n\n• **Save.** Supply USDS to the Sky Savings Rate module of the Sky Protocol to access the Sky Savings Rate and accumulate additional USDS over time. No minimum supply amount is required; withdraw at any time.\n• **Access Sky Token Rewards.** Supply USDS to the Sky Token Rewards module of the Sky Protocol to access rewards over time. No minimum USDS supply amount is required; withdraw at any time.\n\n• **Access Staking Rewards.** Supply SKY tokens to the Staking Engine of the Sky Protocol to create a position, enabling you to access Staking Rewards, borrow USDS, and transfer the voting power of supplied SKY tokens to a recognized delegate or a contract that you own.\n\nYou may exit your position(s) at any time; no exit fee applies.\n\n• **Connect with SkyLink.** SkyLink is the Sky system that provides the rails for Sky Ecosystem projects, such as [Spark](https://spark.fi/), to link assets between the Sky Protocol on Ethereum Mainnet and supported L2 networks. This enables end users on L2s, such as Base and Arbitrum for example, to tap into Sky Protocol features via the Sky Ecosystem projects' rails.\n\nWith Sky.money, you always remain in control of your supplied assets."

This means you are always able to actively manage your positions.\n\nThe debt ceiling and Borrow Rate are parameters determined by Sky Ecosystem Governance through a process of decentralized, community-driven onchain voting. The total debt increases each block according to the Borrow Rate.\n\nUSDS borrow positions are subject to liquidation risk if at any time the value of supplied collateral drops below the required threshold ([liquidation price](#tooltip-liquidation-price-staking)) and the position becomes undercollateralized. If this were to occur, the smart contract would automatically liquidate and auction the collateral, and any leftover collateral may be claimed through the [Unified Auctions portal](https://unified-auctions.makerdao.com/)."

      },
      {
        "question": "What are the characteristics of USDS?",
        "answer": "USDS is a native stablecoin of the Sky Protocol. It contributes significantly to the stability and economic value the Protocol and to the Sky Ecosystem due to several of its key characteristics, including:\n\n• **Accessibility.** USDS is inclusive. Regardless of economic standing, anyone with internet access can access the Ethereum blockchain and use USDS.\n\n• **Round-the-clock availability.** USDS is attainable 24/7.\n\n• **Speed and affordability.** Because USDS moves on the blockchain, users can transfer it across the globe within seconds and at a fraction of the cost of wire services via traditional finance (TradFi). Users only pay a blockchain transaction, or gas, fee.\n\n• **Transparency.** The Sky Protocol is transparent. Users have complete insight into all USDS and other Sky Protocol token transactions.\n\n• **Security.** The design of the blockchain and its network of nodes, miners and validators, combined with the fact that cryptocurrencies like USDS are rooted in cryptography, enhance user security.\n\n• **Trading options.** Popular tokens can be traded for USDS at current market prices using permissionless rails. With the non-custodial Sky.money web app, you can access the decentralized Sky Protocol to directly trade on the blockchain instead of relying on centralized entities.\n\n• **Ecosystem builder.** USDS is a key component of the Sky Ecosystem and the decentralized finance (DeFi) movement. The more people use USDS, the more the Sky Protocol and DeFi ecosystems, generally, expand."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is USDS pegged to the U.S. dollar or soft-pegged to the U.S. dollar?",
        "answer": "USDS is soft-pegged to the U.S. dollar, meaning that it is designed to stay close to $1 in value, but doesn't guarantee a strict 1:1 value ratio with the U.S. dollar. Its value can fluctuate based on market conditions. For example, USDS might trade at \\+/-$1, depending on supply and demand. Importantly, the stability of USDS is supported by various mechanisms within the Sky Protocol, including overcollateralization and the use of Peg Stability Modules (PSMs), which help manage its price relative to the dollar."

You can use USDS to participate in the Sky Savings Rate to accumulate additional USDS, and to access Sky Token Rewards via the Sky.money web app."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is the USDS stablecoin superior to DAI?",
        "answer": "USDS can be used in several ways DAI cannot, including to participate in the Sky Savings Rate and to access Sky Token Rewards without giving up control of your assets. Both USDS and DAI are backed by a surplus of collateral and soft-pegged to the value of the U.S. dollar, meaning each is designed to maintain a value equal to or close to a dollar. They are both native Sky Protocol tokens maintained by a broad and diversified community of individuals and entities from around the world who hold SKY, the native governance token of the Sky Protocol."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I acquire USDS stablecoins?",
        "answer": "You can use the Sky.money web app, a non-custodial gateway to the decentralized Sky Protocol, to trade USDC, USDT, ETH or SKY for USDS (or vice versa). You can also upgrade your DAI to USDS, subject to any applicable blockchain transaction, or gas, fees. Gas fees are neither controlled, imposed nor received by Sky.money or the Sky Protocol. You can also obtain USDS on various crypto exchanges that decide to make it available on their platforms."

        "question": "How can I use USDS?",
        "answer": "Like other decentralized stablecoins, USDS is freely transferable and can be used in connection with any software protocol or platform that supports it. Unlike other stablecoins, you can use USDS to participate in the Sky Savings Rate to accumulate additional USDS over time, and to access Sky Token Rewards, without giving up control of your digital assets. When you select SKY as your Sky Token Reward, you can participate—if you choose to do so—in the governance of the Sky Ecosystem."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do USDS and DAI maintain stability and benefit the ecosystem?",
        "answer": "Overcollateralization and other mechanisms helps USDS maintain stability while also helping to manage risk.\n\nOvercollateralization means that the total value of the collateral that backs a specific stablecoin must always be higher than the aggregate value of all of those stablecoins in circulation.\n\nOther mechanisms of the decentralized Sky Protocol that are used to keep USDS stable are Peg Stability Modules (PSMs) and the Smart Burn Engine (SBE):\n\n• **Peg Stability Modules (PSMs).** Peg Stability Modules (PSMs) are smart contracts that allow users to convert certain stablecoins directly with the Sky Protocol for USDS or DAI at a fixed rate and with relatively low fees; however, blockchain (gas) fees may apply. Unlike decentralized exchange (DEX) transactions, PSM operations do not involve trading between users. Instead, they are direct, non-custodial conversions (generate and burn) executed with the decentralized smart contracts of the Sky Protocol.\n\n• **The Smart Burn Engine (SBE).** The Smart Burn Engine is a smart contract that programmatically acquires SKY on the DeFi markets and deposits it into Sky Protocol-owned USDS/SKY liquidity pools using Sky Protocol surplus once the Surplus Buffer has hit a certain threshold set by Sky Ecosystem Governance. Depositing SKY into these pools improves token liquidity and also increases the capital buffers of the Sky Protocol. Note that the SBE no longer holds DAI and MKR. and it no longer buys MKR.\n\nImportantly, the [Sky Ecosystem Dashboard](https://info.sky.money/) allows anyone to examine the health of the decentralized Sky Protocol in real time.\n\nFor details on the risks associated with soft-pegged stablecoins, review the [User Risk Documentation](https://docs.sky.money/user-risks)."

        "question": "Do I need to do anything with the DAI I've supplied to the DAI Savings Rate (DSR) contract?",
        "answer": "The DAI Savings Rate (DSR) contract remains unchanged, so you don't need to immediately do anything to your DAI in the DSR module. You can, however, withdraw your DSR position, and, if you're an eligible user of the Sky.money web app, upgrade your DAI to USDS, and then use the USDS to access the Sky Savings Rate."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is DAI?",
        "answer": "DAI is a stablecoin of the Sky Protocol. It is decentralized, backed by a surplus of collateral, soft-pegged to the value of the U.S. dollar, and easily user-generated and accessed. DAI is maintained by and will continue to be maintained by Sky Ecosystem Governance unless and until that body decides otherwise by vote. DAI can be upgraded to USDS, which powers the Sky Ecosystem."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is MKR?",
        "answer": "MKR was the governance token of MakerDAO, which was rebranded to the Sky Ecosystem in September 2024. For a brief period of time, MKR joined SKY as a governance token of the Sky Ecosystem. In the spring of 2025, the Sky Ecosystem Governance community approved the upgrade of MKR to SKY, establishing SKY as the sole governance token of the Sky Protocol. The upgrade is at the rate of 1:24,000 (1 MKR = 24,000 SKY).\n\nAs the technical and functional evolution of MKR, SKY maintains the governance functionalities previously held by MKR.

The upgrade is at the rate of 1:24,000 (1 MKR = 24,000 SKY).\n\n### **Voting with SKY**\n\nSKY is now the sole governance token of the Sky Protocol and Ecosystem. You can use your SKY to participate directly in governance through a system of decentralized onchain voting and/or to entrust your voting power to one or more delegates or a contract that you own. Voting with MKR is no longer possible.\n\n### **Staking SKY**\n\nWhen you stake SKY tokens to the Staking Engine using the Sky.money web app, you can access Staking Rewards and may also choose to create one or more positions, including positions that enable you to generate and borrow USDS against your supplied SKY and to delegate the voting power your SKY tokens provide.\n\nYou may exit your Staking positions at any time; no exit fee applies. Staking Rewards Rates and the Borrow Rate are determined by Sky Ecosystem Governance through the process of decentralized onchain voting.\n\nYour SKY, as well as any Staking Rewards that you accumulate, is supplied to a non-custodial smart contract, such that no intermediary ever takes custody of those tokens."

Beware of fake sites with barely noticeable typos in the address.\n\n• Cross-check the [Sky.money website](https://sky.money/) and the Sky.money web app information and details with official Sky social media accounts (i.e,, [X](https://x.com/skyecosystem), [Sky Discord](https://discord.com/invite/skyecosystem), [Sky Builder Discord](https://discord.gg/skybuilder) and the [Sky Forum](https://forum.sky.money/)).\n\n• Be suspicious of DMs on social media sites. Scammers have been known to impersonate project team members.\n\n**Verify related smart contracts**\n\n• Check the upgrade smart contracts in the [Developer Documentation](https://developers.sky.money/). Legitimate projects make their contracts public.\n• Look up the contract on the appropriate network block explorer (e.g., Etherscan) to verify its authenticity.\n\n**Beware of fake promotions, airdrops and bonus offers**\n\n• Scammers sometimes advertise fake contests, airdrops or extra tokens as a bonus. Stay alert.\n\n**Use a hardware wallet for added security**\n\n• If possible, use a hardware wallet to interact with smart contracts.\n• Never share your private key or seed phrase.\n• Review transaction details carefully before signing. Scam apps may succeed in draining wallets instead of swapping tokens.\n\n**Test transactions**\n\n• Before transacting using a large number of tokens, test the process with a small amount first. If something looks suspicious (e.g., unexpected approval requests), stop and verify before proceeding."

        "question": "What is a trade?",
        "answer": "A trade is the direct exchange of one cryptocurrency token for another. Trading can occur on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and centralized exchanges (CEXs).\n\nA decentralized exchange (DEX) is a peer-to-peer marketplace made up of smart contracts where users can buy, sell and trade cryptocurrencies without having to share any personal information. No financial institution or third party is needed to facilitate DEX transactions. Not all DEXs operate in the same way. To buy crypto on a specific DEX may require knowledge of that DEXs functions and/or underlying code base.\n\nA centralized exchange (CEX) is a marketplace where users create an account by providing identifying information and documentation to a centralized entity in order to buy, sell and trade cryptocurrencies. Importantly, a CEX facilitates exchanges, meaning it acts as an intermediary between buyers and sellers. Some CEXs also require users to opt-in to one or more custodial wallets rather than use a private, non-custodial wallet. Your use of any centralized exchange will likely be subject to that exchange's terms of service and applicable regulatory requirements."

        "question": "What is an exchange rate?",

      },
      {
        "question": "Why do token prices vary between different DEXs and CEXs?",
        "answer": "Token prices vary between different exchanges due to key market dynamics, such as:\n\n• **Market Structure.** DEXs typically use automated market makers (AMMs), which price based on algorithms. CEXs typically use order books, which price based on actual bids/asks. The different mechanisms can lead to different price discoveries.\n\n• **Market Segmentation.** Not all traders can access all exchanges for various reasons, including jurisdiction restrictions and Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements. Some exchanges may have more institutional flow versus retail flow, and different user bases can lead to different price dynamics.\n\n• **Market Making and Liquidity.** Every exchange has its own separate liquidity pools and market makers. Different depths of liquidity pools affect how much the prices impact trades. Market makers provide buy and sell quotes in a market and attempt to profit from the spread between the bid and ask prices. Market makers may also help ensure smooth trading by absorbing temporary imbalances between buyers and sellers. Some exchanges may have tighter spreads due to better market making.\n\n• **Arbitrage Opportunities.** Price differences may create profit opportunities for traders. Arbitrageurs buy on cheaper exchanges and sell on more expensive ones. That process helps prices converge, but differences persist due to transaction costs (e.g., gas and trading fees), execution speed, capital requirements and the technical complexity of the arbitrage."

        "question": "How are Sky Token Rewards funded?",
        "answer": "Users can supply USDS to the Sky Token Rewards module of the Sky Protocol to receive rewards in the form of SKY tokens, Sky Star tokens, and Chronicle points. Sky Protocol reward mechanisms are designed to balance incentives for users while maintaining sustainability and minimizing unnecessary inflation. Rewards are funded as follows:\n\n• **SKY as rewards:** The protocol calculates the market value of SKY to be rewarded, adjusts the quantity accordingly and buys it from the market using protocol revenues (USDS), and then distributes that SKY as rewards from the treasury. The budget, rate, and mechanics are set (and can be changed) by Sky Ecosystem Governance and the governance-configured rewards contracts.\n\n• **Star tokens as rewards:** Currently, Star Token Rewards are distributed to USDS suppliers using the returns from Sky investments in those Stars. This is not inflationary for the Sky Protocol, as these are external tokens acquired through investment.\n\n• **Chronicle Points as rewards:** USDS suppliers can opt to receive Chronicle Points, which might ultimately become claimable for Chronicle tokens (CLE) at a rate of 10 points for every 1 CLE token. The total supply of CLE tokens is anticipated to be 10 billion. Chronicle Points are emitted at a rate of 3.75 billion per year. Any future opportunities to convert Chronicle Points into CLE tokens would be managed independently by Chronicle's own applications."

        "question": "How much does it cost to participate in Sky Token Rewards?",
        "answer": "There is no fee to participate in the Sky Token Rewards feature of the Sky Protocol; however, with each transaction, you will likely pay a transaction, or gas, fee for using the Ethereum blockchain network. That fee is neither controlled, imposed nor received by Sky.money or the Sky Protocol.\n\nNote that if you have shied away from the Ethereum blockchain due to the high price of gas, the average price of gas on Ethereum has dropped significantly as a result of the 2024 Dencum upgrade."

      },
      {
        "question": "What are some additional risks that stUSDS holders face?",
        "answer": "stUSDS is a risk token that derives its value from positions collateralized by staked SKY within the Staking Engine. During the initial launch of stUSDS, deposits may be temporarily illiquid when utilization exceeds 100 percent. This condition is expected to continue until total deposits in the stUSDS module surpass 55 million USDS.\n\nIf liquidation of a borrower’s staked SKY collateral does not fully cover outstanding debt, stUSDS balances may incur a proportional haircut.\n\nProspective users should understand that stUSDS is a risk-bearing position designed for expert participants who are comfortable with potential loss scenarios tied to system performance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why might stUSDS deposits become temporarily illiquid?",
        "answer": "During the initial launch of stUSDS, deposits may be temporarily illiquid when utilization exceeds 100 percent. This condition is expected to continue until total deposits in the stUSDS module surpass 55 million USDS.\n\nTo compensate participants for the added illiquidity risk during the early phase, the stUSDS reward rate is temporarily set at a 40% APY as a short-term bootstrapping incentive. Once deposits exceed 55 million USDS, utilization should fall below 100 percent, withdrawals will resume normally, and rates will adjust dynamically based on market conditions."
      },
      {
        "question": "How are stUSDS rewards funded?",
        "answer": "The rewards distributed to stUSDS holders come from the interest paid by SKY borrowers (the SKY Borrow Rate) and protocol revenues. The capital for SKY-backed borrowing is provided by Expert Module users who deposit USDS to access the stUSDS Rate and receive stUSDS in return. The stUSDS tokens serve as a digital record of their USDS interaction with the stUSDS module and any change to the value of their position."

        "answer": "No minimum supply amount is required to access the stUSDS Rate; however, there is a cap, set by Sky Ecosystem Governance, on how much USDS the stUSDS vault can accept. Withdrawals are available as long as the stUSDS pool has sufficient idle USDS. Since deposits fund SKY‑backed loans, withdrawal capacity depends on current utilization: when most liquidity is lent out, withdrawals may be limited until repayments occur or liquidity returns."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the conversion rate for stUSDS?",
        "answer": "The stUSDS conversion rate floats and generally increases over time as yield accrues. At launch it is typically 1.0 and rises as earnings accumulate. Loss events (e.g., liquidation shortfalls) reduce the exchange rate via a proportional haircut."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I supply/withdraw USDS to/from the stUSDS module anytime?",
        "answer": "Generally, yes—deposits and withdrawals are designed to be available at any time, but there are a couple of caveats:\n\nLiquidity availability: Withdrawals depend on the module having enough liquid USDS. If utilization is very high, you may need to wait for borrowers to repay or for liquidity to return, or withdraw partially.\nRate/fee changes: Sky Ecosystem Governance can update parameters (rates, caps) and may impose temporary safeguards during stress."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why are the risks and the rewards associated with stUSDS different to that of sUSDS?",
        "answer": "stUSDS holders earn yield but also take on the risk of funding SKY‑backed borrowing. If a borrower’s staked SKY collateral is liquidated and the proceeds don’t fully cover the debt, the stUSDS vault absorbs the shortfall via a proportional haircut to the vault’s exchange rate (i.e., each stUSDS redeems for fewer USDS). This design ring‑fences losses to the stUSDS module, so the broader Sky Protocol is insulated from deficits arising in the SKY‑backed borrowing facility. So, sUSDS carries protocol-level risk but not borrower-shortfall risk, whereas stUSDS does bear that shortfall risk."

When you stake SKY tokens using the Sky.money web app, you can access Staking Rewards and may also choose to create one or more positions, including positions that enable you to generate and borrow USDS against your supplied SKY and to delegate the voting power the SKY token provides. Here's a brief overview:\n\n• **Access Rewards.** Supply SKY tokens to access Staking Rewards. Staking Reward rates are determined by Sky Ecosystem Governance through the process of decentralized onchain voting.\n\n• **Borrow.** Borrow USDS against your supplied SKY. You can exit your borrow position at any time and withdraw or pay back USDS whenever you would like. The USDS Borrow Rate and debt ceiling are determined by Sky Ecosystem Governance through the process of decentralized onchain voting. Your total debt increases each block according to the Borrow Rate.\n\n• **Delegate.** Transfer the voting power of your supplied SKY tokens to a recognized delegate or a contract that you own. Your chosen delegate can then participate in the Sky Ecosystem Governance voting process on your behalf. You can choose one delegate per position, meaning if you want to entrust your SKY to two different delegates using the Staking Engine, you will need to create two separate positions.\n\nYou may exit your Staking positions at any time; no exit fee applies. Staking Rewards Rates and the Borrow Rate are determined by Sky Ecosystem Governance through the process of decentralized onchain voting.\n\nYour SKY, as well as any Staking Rewards that you accumulate, are supplied to a non-custodial smart contract, such that no intermediary ever takes custody of those tokens.

If this were to occur, the system would automatically liquidate and auction the collateral, and any leftover collateral may be claimed through the [Unified Auctions portal](https://unified-auctions.makerdao.com/).\n\n### **The Auction**\n\nThe auction begins with the \"lot\" (i.e., the collateral amount being sold). There are two phases to an auction:\n\n• **Price Discovery Phase:** The decreasing price auction where the system offers a fixed amount of collateral for a decreasing amount of USDS or DAI.\n\n• **Price Recovery Phase:** If needed, bidders compete to accept a smaller portion of the fixed lot of collateral to ensure the maximum USDS or DAI is recovered.\n\n### **Keeper Participation**\n\nMultiple \"keepers\" (individuals or automated bots operated by professional trading firms and market makers) participate in these auctions to help ensure competitive pricing. They monitor for liquidation opportunities and submit bids. Keepers must have USDS or DAI ready to purchase the liquidated collateral.\n\nKeepers might yield a profit by leveraging price differences between the auction price provided by Sky Protocol oracles and the price on exchanges. Similar to a Dutch-style auction system, the auction price starts above the real market price and drops by a defined ratio in defined time intervals.\n\n### **Winning**\n\nThe winning bidder receives the collateral, and the recovered USDS or DAI is used to:\n\n• Repay the position's debt.\n\n• Cover the liquidation penalty, which is determined by Sky Ecosystem Governance through a process of decentralized, community-driven onchain voting.\n\n• Return any surplus to the original position holder.

        "question": "What is the Unichain L2 solution?",
        "answer": "Layer 2 (L2) networks are blockchain scalability solutions built on top of existing blockchains (Layer 1 or L1 networks). While L2s exist across several blockchains, they are most commonly used with the Ethereum blockchain, where they are designed to solve two major problems: high transaction (gas) fees and slow transaction speeds, which can hinder scalability.\n\nL2 solutions usually work by processing transactions on their own blockchain, and then bundling those transactions and submitting them back to the underlying L1 as a single transaction for final validation, which drastically increases the throughput.\n\nMoving assets between L1 and L2 networks requires specialized protocols called bridges. While bridges can be designed to connect any two blockchain networks, L2 networks operate on top of L1s, inheriting their security while delivering improved efficiency.\n\nL2s used with Ethereum not only offer users much lower fees and much faster speeds (transactions can be near-instant), they can enable users to transact using the wallets and tools they are already familiar with. There is a tradeoff, however, as users bridging their assets between L1 and L2 networks generally must pay a transaction fee. For users making multiple transactions, the savings may outweigh that cost and you must use your own discretion. Also, L1 networks may provide stronger security guarantees compared to L2s, which often rely on centralized components and actors, which could potentially introduce points of failure."

The PSM handles conversions programmatically, driven at your direction, between these pairs directly.\n\nOn some supported L2s, you can also access the [Sky Savings Rate](#tooltip-sky-savings-rate).\n\nSkyLink is the Sky system that provides the rails for Sky Ecosystem projects to link assets between the Sky Protocol on Ethereum Mainnet and supported L2 networks. If you have shied away from the Ethereum blockchain due to the high price of gas, SkyLink introduces reduced fees and faster transaction speeds.\n\nAvailable tokens may evolve over time as new trading pairs are added."

        "question": "How does trading on supported L2s differ from trading on Ethereum?",
        "answer": "On Ethereum Mainnet, Base, and Arbitrum, the Sky.money web app features a native integration of [CoW Swap](https://swap.cow.fi/#/1/swap/WETH), a third-party decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator. Please see the [Terms of Use](https://docs.sky.money/legal-terms) for more information on third-party services.\n\nOn Optimism and Unichain, converting between tokens is made possible through a Peg Stability Module [(PSM)](#tooltip-psm)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is the Savings feature experience on L2s the same as on Ethereum Mainnet?",
        "answer": "Some features of Sky.money or the Sky Protocol are not available on supported Layer 2 (L2) solutions. There is no native Sky Savings Rate module deployed to supported L2s, for example. However, on some L2s, both USDS and USDC token support is made possible through a Peg Stability Module (PSM) deployed to those L2s. In those cases, the experience of using the Savings feature on supported Layer 2 (L2) networks and Ethereum is very similar."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is the Sky Savings Rate percentage the same on Ethereum Mainnet and supported L2s?",
        "answer": "Yes, the Sky Savings Rate percentage noted on supported Layer 2 (L2) solutions tracks the rate on Ethereum Mainnet. This is done programmatically in the Peg Stability Module (PSM) where deployed on supported L2s."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is SkyLink, and how does it work?",
        "answer": "SkyLink is the Sky system that provides the rails for Sky Ecosystem projects, such as [Spark](https://spark.fi/), to link assets between the Sky Protocol on Ethereum Mainnet and supported L2 networks. This enables end users on L2s, such as Base and Arbitrum for example, to tap into Sky Protocol features via the Sky Ecosystem projects' rails.\n\nIf you have shied away from the Ethereum blockchain due to the high price of gas, SkyLink introduces reduced fees and faster transaction speeds."

        "question": "What is Sky Ecosystem Governance, and how does it work?",
        "answer": "Sky Ecosystem Governance relies on a decentralized, multi-faceted, detailed and transparent system of decision-making that includes adherence to the Sky Atlas—the definitive rulebook of the Sky Ecosystem, community discussion, polling and onchain voting to maintain the Sky Protocol and the ecosystem. Governance is shared among a broad and diversified community comprising individuals and entities from around the world who hold Sky Ecosystem Governance tokens, SKY. Voting with MKR is no longer possible.\n\nFor a deep dive into the facets and checks and balances of governance, please refer to the [Sky Forum](https://forum.sky.money/), the [Sky Governance Voting Portal](https://vote.sky.money/) and the [Sky Atlas](https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/)."

        "question": "What is the Sky Atlas?",
        "answer": "The [Sky Atlas](https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/) is the definitive rulebook of the Sky Ecosystem, as determined by Sky Ecosystem Governance. It is a Sky artifact—a data structure encompassing Sky documents—which exists to stabilize and streamline the governance process to serve the evolving needs of the ecosystem.\n\nThe Atlas defines important words and phrases, including [Universal Alignment](https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/A.0.1.1.4_Universal_Alignment/fa84d113-a62b-4acc-9c67-23945d7efcdd|693d9aad490a), [Ecosystem Intelligence](https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/A.0.1.1.2_Ecosystem_Intelligence/1be87264-19ef-42c2-8bfd-2bc710c21fe4|693d9aad490a), and [Governance Equilibrium](https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/A.0.1.1.26_Governance_Equilibrium/2c954983-a296-4ebd-845c-c24af0454743|693d9aad490a). It also defines roles, such as [Alignment Conserver](<https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/A.0.1.1.17_Alignment_Conserver_(AC)/f8ca466f-2bd4-45e7-868a-b3099a4ebd26|693d9aad490a>), [Aligned Delegate](<https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/A.0.1.1.18_Aligned_Delegate_(AD)/31f68f91-4194-4d71-8f21-5c9882cc4871|693d9aad490a>), and [Facilitator](https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/A.0.1.1.19_Facilitator/0478f2ff-3408-4c3f-b6f9-d403e2bd4131|693d9aad490a).\n\nThe Atlas is a partially immutable work in progress that will continue to be refined through an improvement proposal and decentralized voting framework until Sky Ecosystem Governance determines that modifications are no longer necessary."

      {
        "question": "How do I vote with SKY?",
        "answer": "SKY token holders can use their SKY to participate directly in Sky Ecosystem Governance through a system of decentralized onchain voting, and/or to transfer the voting power of their SKY tokens to a recognized delegate or a contract that they own. Voting with MKR is no longer possible.\n\n### **Direct Voting with SKY**\n\nSKY holders participate directly in Sky Ecosystem Governance by supplying SKY to the Governance Contract of the Sky Protocol via the [Sky Governance Voting Portal](https://vote.sky.money/). Direct voting is weighted, meaning that voting power is proportional to the number of SKY tokens voters supply to that contract. For example, if 50 voters supply a total of 600 SKY in favor of proposal A, while 100 voters supply a total of 400 SKY in support of proposal B, then Proposal A would win with 60% of the vote. The number of people who voted for a proposal is irrelevant; rather, the combined power of SKY tokens behind a proposal decides the winner.\n\n### **Delegating with SKY**\n\nSKY holders can use their tokens to entrust their voting power to one or more delegates via the Sky Governance Voting portal or the Staking Engine of the Sky Protocol. Sky Ecosystem Governance delegates are chosen and approved by governance vote. Creating a new delegate account can only be done via the Sky Governance Voting Portal.\n\nDelegates in receipt of token voting power can never directly access any SKY tokens delegated to them. Throughout the delegation process, users always own and are in control of their SKY tokens, and can change their delegate(s) at any time (subject to the Sky Protocol's rules that prevent double voting or misuse of delegated voting power). Delegating voting power may be a useful option for SKY token holders who have limited time to allocate to the process and who want to save on the cost of gas involved in voting on their own."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I participate in Sky Ecosystem Governance using both MKR and SKY?",
        "answer": "No. SKY is the sole governance token of the Sky Ecosystem and the upgrade of MKR. Only SKY token holders can use their SKY to participate directly in Sky Ecosystem Governance through a system of decentralized onchain voting, and/or to transfer the voting power of their SKY tokens to a recognized delegate or a contract that they own. Voting with MKR is no longer possible."

      {
        "question": "What is onchain voting?",
        "answer": "Onchain voting is a method used by some decentralized projects—Sky included—to facilitate decision-making and governance processes. This type of voting occurs directly on the blockchain, ensuring a transparent and secure democratic voting process. Onchain voting empowers SKY token holders to have a direct impact on the development and operation of the Sky Protocol.\n\nFor a deep dive into Sky Ecosystem Governance, please refer to the [Sky Atlas](https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/), the [Sky Governance Voting Portal](https://vote.sky.money/) and the [Sky Forum](https://forum.sky.money/)."
