    question: 'What are Sky Star Agents?',
    answer: `Sky Star Agents, informally called Stars, are autonomous and independent decentralized projects within Sky Ecosystem, designed to enable focused, fast-moving innovation and development. They are created by their founders, who define the strategy and operating processes of the Star while also specifying the business logic and innovation goals for the Star. Sky Ecosystem acts as a decentralized platform that provides the governance tools and infrastructure for Star growth and operation.

Each Star has access to Sky Primitives, the modular building blocks behind all Star interactions with Sky and the [Sky Atlas](https://sky-atlas.io/), and is free to have its own treasury, governance processes and community, and governance token. The operations of each Star are governed through its Star Artifact—a document that contains all rules, processes, parameters, and information relevant to the Star. The system is similar to the overall governance framework of Sky, which is based on the Sky Atlas (also an Artifact, but much larger). All Star Artifacts live inside the Sky Atlas as subcomponents.`,

    question: 'How does Star Agent governance work?',
    answer:
      'Each Star Agent operates through its own governance system based on its Star Agent Artifact. This system is similar to the overall governance framework of Sky, which is based on the [Sky Atlas](https://sky-atlas.io/). All Star Agent Artifacts live inside the Sky Atlas as subcomponents.',

  {
    question: 'What is a Star Agent Artifact?',
    answer: `A Star Agent's Artifact is the document that contains all rules, processes, parameters, and other information relevant to that Star. The Star Agent Artifact system is similar to the overall governance framework of Sky, which is based on the [Sky Atlas](https://sky-atlas.io/) (also an Artifact, but much larger). All Star Artifacts live inside the Sky Atlas as subcomponents.

Some Star Agent Artifacts are high-level, focusing on vision, principles and community culture, while others are highly detailed, outlining the management of specific ongoing tasks or relationships.`,

  },
  {
    question: 'What are Star Agent tokens?',
    answer:
      'A Star Agent might opt to have its own governance processes and community, treasury, and governance token as defined in its Artifact. Based on the rules enforced by the [Sky Atlas](https://sky-atlas.io/), any Star governance tokens would have strong security practices, economic safeguards and guardrails placed through their tokenomics and enforced by their own Artifacts and the Atlas.',
