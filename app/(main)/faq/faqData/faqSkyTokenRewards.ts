    question: 'How much USDS do I have to supply to accumulate Sky Token Rewards?',
    answer: `Eligible users can supply any amount of USDS to the Sky Token Rewards module of the decentralized Sky Protocol to begin accessing Sky Token Rewards. There is no minimum amount required. Eligible users can also withdraw their USDS at any time. With the Sky Protocol, you can receive rewards without giving up control of your supplied assets, as the Sky Token Rewards module is non-custodial.`,

    question: 'How is the Sky Token Rewards Rate calculated?',
    answer: `The Sky Token Rewards Rate is different for each type of token rewarded, and always fluctuates, determined by the following factors:

- The issuance rate of the token rewarded, which is determined by Sky Ecosystem Governance;

- The market price of the token rewarded; and

- The user’s proportional supply within the total pool of assets linked to the Sky Token Rewards module.`,

    question: 'How much does it cost to participate in Sky Token Rewards?',
    answer: `There is no fee to participate in the Sky Token Rewards feature of the Sky Protocol; however, with each transaction, you will likely pay a transaction, or gas, fee for using the Ethereum blockchain network. That fee is neither controlled, imposed nor received by Sky.money or the Sky Protocol.

Subject to Sky Ecosystem Governance approval, you might soon be able to access Sky Token Rewards on other blockchains with reduced transaction costs. Note that if you have shied away from the Ethereum blockchain due to the high price of gas, the average price of gas on Ethereum has dropped significantly as a result of the 2024 Dencum upgrade.`,
