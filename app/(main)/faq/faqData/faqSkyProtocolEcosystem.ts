    question: 'What was Maker, who founded it, and why?',
    answer: `Maker was co-founded by Rune Christensen and Nikolai Mushegian in late 2014. It was designed to develop an inclusive decentralized financial (DeFi) platform that aims to provide anyone, anywhere with equal access to an empowering global financial marketplace. Maker quickly found success with the development of its native DAI stablecoin. DAI enabled the Maker Protocol to become the first DeFi liquidity protocol with a product-market fit, bringing real value to the DeFi space.

In 2024, Maker rebranded to Sky Ecosystem. Through this rebranding effort, Sky has since taken the former decentralized Maker Protocol to the next level with new technology that focuses on resilience and simplicity while remaining non-custodial.`,

  {
    question: 'Why rebrand MakerDAO to Sky Ecosystem?',
    answer: `Maker began in 2014, as a small community-governed project responsible for developing the Maker Protocol on the Ethereum blockchain. Maker quickly grew to find success with the development of its DAI stablecoin. DAI enabled the Maker Protocol to become the first decentralized finance (DeFi) liquidity protocol with a product-market fit. The Maker Protocol grew to such an extent that by 2021, effective governance by its monolithic community proved challenging.

While the complexity of Maker had been necessary to pursue the best opportunities in the market, the community felt that there existed scaling issues that ultimately held the project back. The rebrand of Maker to Sky Ecosystem, in 2024, took the former Maker Protocol to the next level with technology that focuses on resilience and simplicity while remaining decentralized and non-custodial. In short, the Sky Protocol offers features and tools, organizational restructuring, and token upgrades (i.e., USDS, the upgraded version of DAI; and SKY, the upgraded version of MKR).

These advancements have vastly improved user experiences and enhanced network resilience while creating more alignment between everyday users, governance participants and the ecosystem as a whole.`,

    question: 'Are Sky and Maker the same?',
    answer:
      'Sky Ecosystem is the rebrand of Maker. Maker became Sky in 2024, taking the Maker Protocol to the next level with new technology that focuses on resilience and simplicity while remaining decentralized and non-custodial. The Sky Protocol is maintained by Sky Ecosystem Governance, and is easy to access and explore via the Sky.money web app, a gateway to the Protocol.',
    categories: ['Sky Protocol & Ecosystem']
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the Sky Protocol?',
    answer: `The Sky Protocol is a decentralized financial application built around its native USDS stablecoin—the largest decentralized yield-generating stablecoin and the third-largest stablecoin overall—supporting access to outstanding risk-adjusted returns on sUSDS. Sky is optimized for financial institutions, fully automated whales, builders and defi users—all entities and individuals looking for a fully decentralized, non-custodial financial system that delivers maximum effectiveness, transparency, and enhanced security at scale.

The Sky Protocol is made up of software code deployed to the Ethereum blockchain and designed to enable Sky Ecosystem to operate autonomously and allow users to engage with blockchain technology. The code consists of smart contracts that are self-executing, trustless, decentralized and permissionless. These smart contracts contain the rules and agreements that constitute the framework of the Sky Protocol, and are what allow for the fast and efficient creation, transfer and validation of digital assets, as well as for Sky Ecosystem Governance.

Smart contracts work a lot like vending machines. A vending machine automatically provides a product once you feed it a coin and choose the product you want. The machine does not call someone at the vending machine company to get permission or further instructions. Similarly, a smart contract automatically provides a specific output (O) when prompted by a specific input (I). For example, a smart contract deployed to serve an ecosystem can send asset to contractors (O) on the first of every month (I), without any help or interference from a payroll manager, bank or other financial institution.

The Sky Protocol features several tokens—USDS, DAI, sUSDS, SKY and MKR—plus the Sky Savings Rate, Sky Token Rewards, the Staking Engine, Expert modules, and more.`,
    categories: ['Sky Protocol & Ecosystem']
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the difference between Sky and SKY?',
    answer: `The difference between "Sky" and "SKY" in the context of Sky Ecosystem is quite straightforward: Sky refers to the Sky brand, the decentralized Sky Protocol and the overall Sky Ecosystem. This includes all of the marketing, operations, governance, and functionalities of the non-custodial platform.

SKY, when written in all caps, is the ticker symbol of the native governance token of the Sky Protocol. SKY token holders have the ability to both participate directly in Sky Ecosystem Governance through a system of decentralized onchain voting and to access Staking Rewards via the Staking Engine of the Sky Protocol.

Understanding this distinction helps you navigate the ecosystem, whether you are accessing the features of the Sky Protocol, engaging effectively in governance, or both.`,

  {
    question: 'Explain Peg Stability Modules, how they work, and their advantages?',
    answer: `Peg Stability Modules (PSMs) are smart contracts that allow users to convert certain stablecoins directly with the Sky Protocol for USDS or DAI at a fixed rate and with relatively low fees. They are designed to maintain the stability of USDS and DAI. Unlike decentralized exchange (DEX) transactions, PSM operations do not involve trading between users. Instead, they are direct, non-custodial conversions (generate and burn) executed with the decentralized smart contracts of the Sky Protocol.

Through PSMs, USDS or DAI is obtained via predictable-rate conversion (typically a 1:1 ratio with certain stablecoins, or, in the case of sUSDS, for an amount reflecting its current price) rather than through borrowing. For example, given the existence of a USDC-backed PSM, a user could supply 100 USDC stablecoins to generate 100 USDS or 100 DAI (minus fees), without taking on any debt. Given that PSM operations are facilitated on the Sky Protocol directly and not on a DEX, price slippage (i.e., the difference between the expected price of a token and the actual price when traded) is not a concern. Zero Sky Protocol fees and no slippage are among the functional advantages of using a PSM, which adds liquidity to the assets backing the PSM. That liquidity helps to keep the value of USDS and DAI stable.

A PSM can only hold an asset that is pegged to the same asset as DAI or USDS because it offers 1-to-1 conversions. A PSM with a non-stable asset would become undercollateralized as soon as the market price of that non-stable asset decreased.

The amount of conversions a PSM can offer is limited by its debt ceiling and the total current amount of collateral tokens supplied to it.

  {
    question: 'What are oracles?',
    answer: `The decentralized, non-custodial Sky Protocol relies on oracles, which are third-party services that provide offchain price feed data to the blockchain. Oracles support DeFi protocols in a number of ways, and offer users and end users the following:

• **Increased stability:** Reliable price data helps ensure efficient collateralization of stablecoins and minimizes the risk of under-collateralized borrowing, safeguarding pegs.

• **Transparency and decentralization:** The use of multiple independent oracle feeds reduces a protocol's or decentralized exchange's reliance on any single source, promoting transparency and trust in a system.

• **Flexibility and innovation:** The modular design of an oracle system allows for both integration of new data sources and feeds, and separation. In other words, oracles can be on- and off-boarded when needs arise.

Sky Core uses oracles provided by [Chronicle](https://chroniclelabs.org/). Please see the [Terms of Use](https://docs.sky.money/legal-terms) for more information on third-party services.`,

    question: 'What is the Surplus Buffer?',
    answer: `The Surplus Buffer is a reserve within the decentralized Sky Protocol where all the USDS revenue earned by the Protocol from fees collected by users are accrued. 

Once the Surplus Buffer reaches a threshold set by Sky Ecosystem Governance, the surplus can be used for protocol-aligned purposes, such as strengthening capital reserves or activating mechanisms like the Smart Burn Engine (SBE). The SBE may use part of the accumulated surplus to acquire SKY on the open market and deposit it into Sky Protocol-owned liquidity pools, which helps to deepen liquidity and support the overall resilience of Sky Ecosystem.

The Surplus Buffer is an important component of Sky Protocol’s self-sustaining design. It ensures that the Protocol maintains a financial cushion for stability while allowing decentralized governance to determine how excess resources are deployed.`,
