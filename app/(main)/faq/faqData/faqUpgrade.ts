    question: 'Why did Sky Ecosystem Governance vote to upgrade MKR to SKY?',
    answer: `The governance-aligned vote to upgrade MKR to SKY, establishing SKY as the sole governance token of the Sky Protocol, reflects the community's desire to streamline governance, increase voter participation, and support the ecosystem's long-term growth and scalability.

The upgrade of MKR to SKY establishes SKY as the technical and functional evolution of MKR, with SKY inheriting the governance functionalities previously held by MKR. The upgrade is at the rate of 1:24,000 (1 MKR = 24,000 SKY).

SKY holders can use the token to vote directly on Sky Ecosystem Governance proposals and/or to transfer their voting power to a recognized delegate or a contract that they own, just as they once could with MKR.

SKY also enables users to access Staking Rewards via the Sky.money web app. When users supply SKY to the Staking Engine of the Sky Protocol, they can access those rewards and may also choose to create one or more positions, including positions that enable them to generate and borrow USDS against their supplied SKY, and to delegate the voting power their supplied SKY tokens provide.

    answer: `When engaging in decentralized finance (DeFi), whether via the Sky Protocol or elsewhere, there is no guaranteed protection against any scammer or scam upgrade apps or tools. However, the following best practices around safety exist for you to consider:

**Verify sources**

• Always make sure you are accessing the correct URLs. Beware of fake sites with barely noticeable typos in the address.

• Cross-check the [Sky.money website](https://sky.money/) and the Sky.money web app information and details with official Sky social media accounts (i.e,, [X](https://x.com/skyecosystem), [Sky Discord](https://discord.com/invite/skyecosystem), [Sky Builder Discord](https://discord.gg/skybuilder) and the [Sky Forum](https://forum.sky.money/)).

• Be suspicious of DMs on social media sites. Scammers have been known to impersonate project team members.

**Verify related smart contracts**

• Check the upgrade smart contracts in the [Developer Documentation](https://developers.sky.money/). Legitimate projects make their contracts public.
• Look up the contract on the appropriate network block explorer (e.g., Etherscan) to verify its authenticity.

**Beware of fake promotions, airdrops and bonus offers**

• Scammers sometimes advertise fake contests, airdrops or extra tokens as a bonus. Stay alert.

**Use a hardware wallet for added security**

• If possible, use a hardware wallet to interact with smart contracts.
• Never share your private key or seed phrase.
• Review transaction details carefully before signing. Scam apps may succeed in draining wallets instead of swapping tokens.

**Test transactions**

• Before transacting using a large number of tokens, test the process with a small amount first. If something looks suspicious (e.g., unexpected approval requests), stop and verify before proceeding.`,

    question: 'Can I still vote and delegate with MKR?',
    answer: `No, MKR is no longer used for Sky Ecosystem Governance. Only SKY, the upgrade of MKR, can be used to participate in Sky Ecosystem Governance voting at the new [Sky Governance Voting Portal](https://vote.sky.money/).

### **How to start voting using SKY**

SKY holders can use the token to vote directly on Sky Ecosystem Governance proposals and/or to transfer the voting power of their SKY tokens to a recognized delegate or a contract that they own. If you are MKR holder who wishes to upgrade your MKR to SKY to vote, you would:

• Go to the Sky.money web app (https://app.sky.money) to upgrade your MKR to SKY.

• Go to the Sky Governance Portal ([https://vote.sky.money/](https://vote.sky.money/)) and:
  • **Approve your SKY.** Permit the new Chief contract to use your SKY tokens.
  • **Deposit SKY.** Lock your SKY tokens into the new Chief contract to activate your voting power or assign your voting power to a delegate of your choice or to a contract that you own.
