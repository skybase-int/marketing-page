    question: 'What is the Delayed Upgrade Penalty?',
    answer: `The Delayed Upgrade Penalty is a time-based upgrade mechanism, approved by Sky Ecosystem Governance, which is designed to facilitate a smooth and prompt upgrade of MKR to SKY.

The penalty, which will [begin September 18, 2025](https://upgrademkrtosky.sky.money), reduces the amount of SKY received per MKR upgraded at a rate of 1%, and increases by 1% every three months thereafter until it reaches 100% in 25 years. The penalty will not apply to anyone upgrading their MKR to SKY before it kicks in.

**How the Delayed Upgrade Penalty works**

Here are some examples:

- If a user upgrades 1 MKR before the Delayed Upgrade Penalty takes effect, the user will not pay a penalty and will receive 24,000 SKY.

- If a user upgrades 1 MKR within three months after the Delayed Upgrade Penalty takes effect, the penalty applies at 1%. So, the amount the user will receive as a result of the upgrade will be 23,760 SKY (24,000 minus 1%).  

- If a user upgrades 1 MKR within three to six months after the Delayed Upgrade Penalty takes effect, the penalty applies at 2%, meaning the user will receive 23,520 SKY (24,000 minus 2%).

Please note that blockchain, or gas, fees for using the Ethereum network apply when upgrading. Blockchain transaction fees are neither controlled, imposed nor received by Sky.money or the Sky Protocol.

    question: 'Why did Sky Ecosystem Governance vote to upgrade MKR to SKY?',
    answer: `The rebrand of MakerDAO to the Sky Ecosystem in September 2024 took the former Maker Protocol to the next level, introducing new technology and features, including an advanced stablecoin, USDS, the upgraded version of DAI. These improvements have vastly enriched user experiences and enhanced network resilience—without compromising the protocol's decentralized and non-custodial design. The governance-aligned vote to upgrade MKR to SKY, establishing SKY as the sole governance token of the Sky Protocol, reflects the community's desire to streamline governance, increase voter participation, and support the ecosystem's long-term growth and scalability.

**SKY inherits governance functionality**

The upgrade of MKR to SKY establishes SKY as the technical and functional evolution of MKR, inheriting the governance functionalities previously held by MKR. The upgrade is at the rate of 1:24,000 (1 MKR = 24,000 SKY).

SKY holders can use the token to vote directly on Sky Ecosystem Governance proposals and/or to transfer their voting power to a recognized delegate or a contract that they own, just as they once could with MKR.

SKY also enables users to access Staking Rewards via the Sky.money web app. When users supply SKY to the Staking Engine of the Sky Protocol, they can access those rewards and may also choose to create one or more positions, including positions that enable them to generate and borrow USDS against their supplied SKY, and to delegate the voting power their supplied SKY tokens provide.

**Why upgrade**

All MKR holders are encouraged to upgrade to SKY promptly to maintain the ability to participate in key decisions shaping the Sky Protocol. Upgrading in a timely fashion ensures reduced governance complexity and a more effective, efficient and resilient ecosystem for all. Please note that while MKR will continue to exist, users will not be able to revert back to MKR from SKY via the Sky Protocol.

To facilitate a smooth and prompt transition, Sky Ecosystem Governance voted to introduce a Delayed Upgrade Penalty. The penalty, which will begin September 18, 2025, reduces the amount of SKY received per MKR upgraded at a rate of 1%, and increases by 1% every three months thereafter until it reaches 100% in 25 years. The penalty will not apply to anyone upgrading their MKR to SKY before it kicks in.

**How the Delayed Upgrade Penalty works**

Here are some examples:

If a user upgrades 1 MKR before the Delayed Upgrade Penalty takes effect, the user will not pay a penalty and will receive 24,000 SKY.

If a user upgrades 1 MKR within three months after the Delayed Upgrade Penalty takes effect, the penalty applies at 1%. So, the amount the user will receive as a result of the upgrade will be 23,760 SKY (24,000 minus 1%).  

If a user upgrades 1 MKR within three to six months after the Delayed Upgrade Penalty takes effect, the penalty applies at 2%, meaning the user will receive 23,520 SKY (24,000 minus 2%).

The SKY accrued in the Sky Protocol as a result of the Delayed Upgrade Penalty is held in the Converter contract and controlled by Sky Ecosystem Governance.

Please note that blockchain, or gas, fees for using the Ethereum network apply when upgrading. Blockchain transaction fees are neither controlled, imposed nor received by Sky.money or the Sky Protocol.

**Verify sources**

• Always make sure you are accessing the correct URLs. Beware of fake sites with barely noticeable typos in the address.

• Cross-check the [Sky.money website](https://sky.money/) and the Sky.money web app information and details with official Sky social media accounts (i.e,, [X](https://x.com/skyecosystem), [Sky Discord](https://discord.com/invite/skyecosystem), [Sky Builder Discord](https://discord.gg/skybuilder) and the [Sky Forum](https://forum.sky.money/)).

• Be suspicious of DMs on social media sites. Scammers have been known to impersonate project team members.

**Verify related smart contracts**

• Check the upgrade smart contracts in the [Developer Documentation](https://developers.sky.money/). Legitimate projects make their contracts public.
• Look up the contract on the appropriate network block explorer (e.g., Etherscan) to verify its authenticity.

**Beware of fake promotions, airdrops and bonus offers**

• Scammers sometimes advertise fake contests, airdrops or extra tokens as a bonus. Stay alert.

**Use a hardware wallet for added security**

• If possible, use a hardware wallet to interact with smart contracts.
• Never share your private key or seed phrase.
• Review transaction details carefully before signing. Scam apps may succeed in draining wallets instead of swapping tokens.

**Test transactions**

• Before transacting using a large number of tokens, test the process with a small amount first. If something looks suspicious (e.g., unexpected approval requests), stop and verify before proceeding.`,
