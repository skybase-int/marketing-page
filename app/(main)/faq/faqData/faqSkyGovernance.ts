    question: 'What is Sky Ecosystem Governance, and how does it work?',
    answer: `Sky Ecosystem Governance relies on a decentralized, multi-faceted, detailed and transparent system of decision-making that includes adherence to the Sky Atlas—the definitive rulebook of the Sky Ecosystem, community discussion, polling and onchain voting to maintain the Sky Protocol and the ecosystem. Governance is shared among a broad and diversified community comprising individuals and entities from around the world who hold Sky Ecosystem Governance tokens, SKY. Voting with MKR is no longer possible.

For a deep dive into the facets and checks and balances of governance, please refer to the [Sky Forum](https://forum.sky.money/), the [Sky Governance Voting Portal](https://vote.sky.money/) and the [Sky Atlas](https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/).`,

      'For a deep dive into the facets and checks and balances of Sky Ecosystem Governance, please refer to the [Sky Forum](https://forum.sky.money/), the [Sky Governance Voting Portal](https://vote.sky.money/), and the [Sky Atlas.](https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/) The Sky Atlas is the definitive rulebook of the Sky Ecosystem, as determined by Sky Ecosystem Governance.',

  {
    question: 'What is the Sky Atlas?',
    answer:
      'The [Sky Atlas](https://sky-atlas.powerhouse.io/) is the definitive rulebook of the Sky Ecosystem, as determined by Sky Ecosystem Governance. It is a Sky artifact—a data structure encompassing Sky documents—which exists to stabilize and streamline the governance process to serve the evolving needs of the ecosystem. The Atlas is a partially immutable work in progress that will continue to be refined through an improvement proposal and decentralized voting framework until Sky Ecosystem Governance determines that modifications are no longer necessary.',

  {
    question: 'How do I vote with SKY?',
    answer: `SKY token holders can use their SKY to participate directly in Sky Ecosystem Governance through a system of decentralized onchain voting, and/or to transfer the voting power of their SKY tokens to a recognized delegate or a contract that they own. Voting with MKR is no longer possible.

### **Direct Voting with SKY**

SKY holders participate directly in Sky Ecosystem Governance by supplying SKY to the Governance Contract of the Sky Protocol via the [Sky Governance Voting Portal](https://vote.sky.money/). Direct voting is weighted, meaning that voting power is proportional to the number of SKY tokens voters supply to that contract. For example, if 50 voters supply a total of 600 SKY in favor of proposal A, while 100 voters supply a total of 400 SKY in support of proposal B, then Proposal A would win with 60% of the vote. The number of people who voted for a proposal is irrelevant; rather, the combined power of SKY tokens behind a proposal decides the winner.

### **Delegating with SKY**

SKY holders can use their tokens to entrust their voting power to one or more delegates via the Sky Governance Voting portal or the Staking Engine of the Sky Protocol. Sky Ecosystem Governance delegates are chosen and approved by governance vote. Creating a new delegate account can only be done via the Sky Governance Voting Portal.

Delegates in receipt of token voting power can never directly access any SKY tokens delegated to them. Throughout the delegation process, users always own and are in control of their SKY tokens, and can change their delegate(s) at any time (subject to the Sky Protocol's rules that prevent double voting or misuse of delegated voting power). Delegating voting power may be a useful option for SKY token holders who have limited time to allocate to the process and who want to save on the cost of gas involved in voting on their own.`,

    question: 'Can I participate in Sky Ecosystem Governance using both MKR and SKY?',
    answer:
      'No. SKY is the sole governance token of the Sky Ecosystem and the upgrade of MKR. Only SKY token holders can use their SKY to participate directly in Sky Ecosystem Governance through a system of decentralized onchain voting, and/or to transfer the voting power of their SKY tokens to a recognized delegate or a contract that they own. Voting with MKR is no longer possible.',

    question: 'What is onchain voting?',
    answer: `Onchain voting is a method used by some decentralized projects—Sky included—to facilitate decision-making and governance processes. This type of voting occurs directly on the blockchain, ensuring a transparent and secure democratic voting process. Onchain voting empowers SKY token holders to have a direct impact on the development and operation of the Sky Protocol.

      "Where can I go for technical help, to report a bug, or to ask questions that aren't answered in the FAQs?",
