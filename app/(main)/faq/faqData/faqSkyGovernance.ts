    question: 'What is Sky Ecosystem Governance, and how does it work?',
    answer: `Sky Ecosystem Governance relies on a decentralized, multi-faceted, detailed and transparent system of decision-making that includes community discussion, polling and onchain voting, and adherence to the [Sky Atlas](https://sky-atlas.io/)—the definitive rulebook of Sky Ecosystem—to maintain the Sky Protocol and the ecosystem. Governance is shared among a broad and diversified community comprising individuals and entities from around the world who hold SKY, the governance token of Sky Ecosystem. Voting with MKR is no longer possible.

For a deep dive into the facets and checks and balances of governance, please refer to the [Sky Forum](https://forum.sky.money/), the [Sky Governance Voting Portal](https://vote.sky.money/) and the [Sky Atlas](https://sky-atlas.io/).`,

      'For a deep dive into the facets and checks and balances of Sky Ecosystem Governance, please refer to the [Sky Forum](https://forum.sky.money/), the [Sky Governance Voting Portal](https://vote.sky.money/), and the [Sky Atlas.](https://sky-atlas.io/).

  {
    question: 'What is the Sky Atlas?',
    answer: `The [Sky Atlas](https://sky-atlas.io/) is the definitive rulebook of Sky Ecosystem, as determined by Sky Ecosystem Governance. It is a Sky artifact—a data structure encompassing Sky documents, which exists to stabilize and streamline the governance process to serve the evolving needs of the ecosystem.

The Atlas is a partially immutable work in progress that will continue to be refined through an improvement proposal and decentralized voting framework until Sky Ecosystem Governance determines that modifications are no longer necessary.`,

  {
    question: 'How do I vote with SKY?',
    answer: `SKY token holders can use their SKY to participate directly in Sky Ecosystem Governance through a system of decentralized onchain voting, and/or to transfer the voting power of their SKY tokens to a recognized delegate or a contract that they own. Voting with MKR is no longer possible.

### **Direct Voting with SKY**

SKY holders participate directly in Sky Ecosystem Governance by supplying SKY to the Governance Contract of the Sky Protocol via the [Sky Governance Voting Portal](https://vote.sky.money/). Direct voting uses a token-weighted model, where voting power corresponds to the amount of SKY that a voter supplies to the relevant governance contract. The outcome of a vote is determined by the total SKY supporting each option. For example, if one proposal has 600 SKY supplied in its favor and another has 400 SKY supplied, the first would hold 60 percent of the voting power. The number of individual participants does not determine the result; only the aggregate SKY associated with each proposal is counted.

### **Delegating with SKY**

SKY holders can use their tokens to entrust their voting power to one or more delegates via the Sky Governance Voting portal or the Staking Engine of the Sky Protocol. Sky Ecosystem Governance delegates are chosen and approved by governance vote. Creating a new delegate account can only be done via the Sky Governance Voting Portal.

Delegates granted voting power can never directly access any SKY tokens delegated to them. Throughout the delegation process, users always own and are in control of their SKY tokens, and can change their delegate(s) at any time (subject to the Sky Protocol's rules that prevent double voting or misuse of delegated voting power). Delegating voting power may be a useful option for SKY token holders who have limited time to allocate to the process and who want to save on the cost of gas involved in voting on their own.`,

    question: 'Can I participate in Sky Ecosystem Governance using both MKR and SKY?',
    answer:
      'No. SKY is the sole governance token of tSky Ecosystem and the upgrade of MKR. Only SKY token holders can use their SKY to participate directly in Sky Ecosystem Governance through a system of decentralized onchain voting, and/or to transfer the voting power of their SKY tokens to a recognized delegate or a contract that they own. Voting with MKR is no longer possible.',

  {
    question: 'What is onchain voting?',
    answer: `Onchain voting is a method used by some decentralized projects—Sky included—to facilitate decision-making and governance processes. This type of voting occurs directly on the blockchain, ensuring a transparent and secure democratic voting process. Onchain voting empowers SKY token holders to have a direct impact on the development and operation of the Sky Protocol.

    question: 'How is voting power calculated in Sky Ecosystem Governance?',
    answer: `SKY holders can use their SKY to vote directly on Sky Ecosystem Governance proposals and/or to transfer the voting power of their SKY tokens to a recognized delegate or a contract that they own.

  {
    question: 'Can I lose my SKY tokens when voting?',
    answer:
      'When you deposit your SKY tokens into the Governance Contract (or delegate them), the tokens are held by the contract to back your voting power. They are not sold, traded, or burned simply because you vote. You retain ownership of your tokens. You can withdraw your SKY from the contract whenever you’d like, as long as it is not supporting an active executive vote.',

      'To participate in discussions regarding Sky Ecosystem Governance and risk, join the [Sky Forum](https://forum.sky.money/), a public platform that includes conversation threads, tagging, categorization and active moderation. Other platforms used by the Sky Ecosystem community, such as [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/skyecosystem) and X ([@SkyEcosystem](https://x.com/SkyEcosystem)), cover all other Sky topics and are much less formal.',
