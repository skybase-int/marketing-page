    question: 'Why should I upgrade my MKR to SKY?',
    answer: `The governance-aligned vote to upgrade MKR to SKY, establishing SKY as the sole governance token of the Sky Protocol, reflects the community's desire to streamline governance, increase voter participation, and support the ecosystem's long-term growth and scalability. Simply put, SKY is the technical and functional evolution of MKR, inheriting the governance functionalities previously held by MKR. 

SKY holders can use the token to vote directly on Sky Ecosystem Governance proposals and/or to transfer the voting power of their SKY tokens to a recognized delegate or a contract that they own, just as they once could with MKR. SKY also enables users to access Staking Rewards via the [Sky.money web app](https://app.sky.money).

    question: 'What is the Delayed Upgrade Penalty?',
    answer: `The Delayed Upgrade Penalty is a time-based upgrade mechanism, approved by Sky Ecosystem Governance, which is designed to facilitate a smooth and prompt upgrade of MKR to SKY.

The penalty, which will [begin September 18, 2025](https://upgrademkrtosky.sky.money), reduces the amount of SKY received per MKR upgraded at a rate of 1%, and increases by 1% every three months thereafter until it reaches 100% in 25 years. The penalty will not apply to anyone upgrading their MKR to SKY before it kicks in.

**How the Delayed Upgrade Penalty works**

Here are some examples:

- If a user upgrades 1 MKR before the Delayed Upgrade Penalty takes effect, the user will not pay a penalty and will receive 24,000 SKY.

- If a user upgrades 1 MKR three months after the Delayed Upgrade Penalty takes effect, the penalty applies at 1%. So, the amount the user will receive as a result of the upgrade will be 23,760 SKY (24,000 minus 1%).  

- If a user upgrades 1 MKR six months after the Delayed Upgrade Penalty takes effect, the penalty applies at 2%, meaning the user will receive 23,520 SKY (24,000 minus 2%).

Please note that blockchain, or gas, fees for using the Ethereum network apply when upgrading. Blockchain transaction fees are neither controlled, imposed nor received by Sky.money or the Sky Protocol.

    question: 'Why did Sky Ecosystem Governance vote to upgrade MKR to SKY?',
    answer: `The rebrand of MakerDAO to the Sky Ecosystem in September 2024 took the former Maker Protocol to the next level, introducing new technology and features, including an advanced stablecoin, USDS, the upgraded version of DAI. These improvements have vastly enriched user experiences and enhanced network resilience—without compromising the protocol's decentralized and non-custodial design. The governance-aligned vote to upgrade MKR to SKY, establishing SKY as the sole governance token of the Sky Protocol, reflects the community's desire to streamline governance, increase voter participation, and support the ecosystem's long-term growth and scalability.

**SKY inherits governance functionality**

The upgrade of MKR to SKY establishes SKY as the technical and functional evolution of MKR, inheriting the governance functionalities previously held by MKR. The upgrade is at the rate of 1:24,000 (1 MKR = 24,000 SKY).

SKY holders can use the token to vote directly on Sky Ecosystem Governance proposals and/or to transfer their voting power to a recognized delegate or a contract that they own, just as they once could with MKR.

SKY also enables users to access Staking Rewards via the Sky.money web app. When users supply SKY to the Staking Engine of the Sky Protocol, they can access those rewards and may also choose to create one or more positions, including positions that enable them to generate and borrow USDS against their supplied SKY, and to delegate the voting power their supplied SKY tokens provide.

**Why upgrade**

All MKR holders are encouraged to upgrade to SKY promptly to maintain the ability to participate in key decisions shaping the Sky Protocol. Upgrading in a timely fashion ensures reduced governance complexity and a more effective, efficient and resilient ecosystem for all. Please note that while MKR will continue to exist, users will not be able to revert back to MKR from SKY via the Sky Protocol.

To facilitate a smooth and prompt transition, Sky Ecosystem Governance voted to introduce a Delayed Upgrade Penalty. The penalty, which will begin September 18, 2025, reduces the amount of SKY received per MKR upgraded at a rate of 1%, and increases by 1% every three months thereafter until it reaches 100% in 25 years. The penalty will not apply to anyone upgrading their MKR to SKY before it kicks in.

**How the Delayed Upgrade Penalty works**

Here are some examples:

If a user upgrades 1 MKR before the Delayed Upgrade Penalty takes effect, the user will not pay a penalty and will receive 24,000 SKY.

If a user upgrades 1 MKR three months after the Delayed Upgrade Penalty takes effect, the penalty applies at 1%. So, the amount the user will receive as a result of the upgrade will be 23,760 SKY (24,000 minus 1%).  

If a user upgrades 1 MKR six months after the Delayed Upgrade Penalty takes effect, the penalty applies at 2%, meaning the user will receive 23,520 SKY (24,000 minus 2%).

The SKY accrued in the Sky Protocol as a result of the Delayed Upgrade Penalty is held in the Converter contract and controlled by Sky Ecosystem Governance.

Please note that blockchain, or gas, fees for using the Ethereum network apply when upgrading. Blockchain transaction fees are neither controlled, imposed nor received by Sky.money or the Sky Protocol.

**How to start voting using SKY**

- SKY holders can use the token to vote directly on Sky Ecosystem Governance proposals and/or to transfer the voting power of their SKY tokens to a recognized delegate or a contract that they own. If you are MKR holder who wishes to upgrade your MKR to SKY to vote, you would:

- Go to the Maker Governance Portal (https://vote.makerdao.com/) to remove your MKR from the old Chief contract or, if applicable, un-delegate your MKR from the delegate you've chosen to vote on your behalf.

- Go to the Sky.money web app (https://app.sky.money) to upgrade your MKR to SKY.

Go to the Sky Governance Portal (https://vote.sky.money/) and:
* **Approve your SKY.** Permit the new Chief contract to use your SKY tokens.
* **Deposit SKY.** Lock your SKY tokens into the new Chief contract to activate your voting power or assign your voting power to a delegate of your choice or to a contract that you own.
* **Vote.** Review the latest Polls and Executive Proposals and take action.

Simply put, this upgrade strengthens the integrity, effectiveness and usefulness of the Sky protocol while expanding governance participation.

All MKR holders are encouraged to upgrade to SKY promptly to maintain the ability to participate in key decisions shaping the Sky Protocol. Upgrading in a timely fashion ensures reduced governance complexity and a more effective, efficient and resilient ecosystem for all.

    question: 'Are SKY and MKR the same?',
    answer: `Think of SKY not as different from MKR, but as the technical and functional evolution of MKR, with SKY inheriting the governance functionalities previously held by MKR. The upgrade is at the rate of 1:24,000 (1 MKR = 24,000 SKY).

**Voting with SKY**

SKY is the sole governance token of the Sky Ecosystem and the upgrade of MKR. SKY token holders can use their SKY to participate directly in Sky Ecosystem Governance through a system of decentralized onchain voting, and/or to entrust their voting power to one or more governance delegates or a contract that they own. Voting with MKR is no longer possible.

**Direct Voting with SKY**

SKY holders participate directly in Sky Ecosystem Governance by supplying SKY to the Governance Contract of the Sky Protocol via the [Sky Governance Voting Portal](https://vote.sky.money/). Direct voting is weighted, meaning that voting power is proportional to the number of SKY tokens voters supply to that contract. For example, if 50 voters supply a total of 600 SKY in favor of proposal A, while 100 voters supply a total of 400 SKY in support of proposal B, then Proposal A would win with 60% of the vote. The number of people who voted for a proposal is irrelevant; rather, the combined power of SKY tokens behind a proposal decides the winner.

**Delegating with SKY**

SKY holders can use their tokens to entrust their voting power to one or more delegates via the Sky Governance Voting portal or the Staking Engine of the Sky Protocol. Sky Ecosystem Governance delegates are chosen and approved by governance vote. Creating a new delegate account can only be done via the Sky Governance Voting Portal.

Delegates in receipt of token voting power can never directly access any SKY tokens delegated to them. Throughout the delegation process, users always own and are in control of their SKY tokens and can change their delegate(s) at any time (subject to the Sky Protocol's rules that prevent double voting or misuse of delegated voting power). Delegating voting power may be a useful option for SKY token holders who have limited time to allocate to the process and who want to save on the cost of gas involved in voting on their own.

**Staking SKY**

When you supply SKY tokens to the Staking Engine using the [Sky.money web app](https://app.sky.money), you can access Staking Rewards and may also choose to create one or more positions, including positions that enable you to generate and borrow USDS against your supplied SKY and to delegate the voting power your SKY tokens provide. Here's a brief overview:

* **Access Rewards.** Supply SKY tokens to access Staking Rewards, initially in the form of USDS. Staking Reward rates are determined by Sky Ecosystem Governance through the process of decentralized onchain voting.

* **Borrow.** Borrow USDS against your supplied SKY. You can exit your borrow position at any time and withdraw or pay back USDS whenever you would like. The USDS Borrow Rate and Debt Ceiling are determined by Sky Ecosystem Governance through the process of decentralized onchain voting. Your total debt increases each block according to the Borrow Rate.

* **Delegate.** Transfer the voting power of your supplied SKY tokens to a recognized delegate or a contract that you own. Your chosen delegate can then participate in the Sky Ecosystem Governance voting process on your behalf. You can choose one delegate per position, meaning if you want to entrust your SKY to two different delegates using the Staking Engine, you will need to create two separate positions.

You may exit your Staking positions at any time; no exit fee applies. The Staking Reward rate and Borrow rate are determined by Sky Ecosystem Governance through the process of decentralized onchain voting.

Your SKY, as well as any Staking Rewards that you accumulate, is supplied to a non-custodial smart contract, such that no intermediary ever takes custody of those tokens. With Sky, you always remain in control of your assets.`,

- Cross-check the [Sky.money website](https://sky.money/) and the [Sky.money web app](https://app.sky.money) information and details with official Sky social media accounts (i.e., [X](https://x.com/skyecosystem), [Sky Discord](https://discord.com/invite/skyecosystem), [Sky Builder Discord](https://discord.gg/skybuilder) and the [Sky Forum](https://forum.sky.money/)).

- Be suspicious of DMs on social media sites. Scammers have been known to impersonate project team members.

**Verify related smart contracts**

- Check the upgrade smart contracts in the [Developer Documentation](https://developers.sky.money/). Legitimate projects make their contracts public.

- Look up the contract on the appropriate network block explorer (e.g., Etherscan) to verify its authenticity.

**Beware of fake promotions, airdrops and bonus offers**

- Scammers sometimes advertise fake contests, airdrops or extra tokens as a bonus. Stay alert.

**Use a hardware wallet for added security**

- If possible, use a hardware wallet to interact with smart contracts.

- Never share your private key or seed phrase.

- Review transaction details carefully before signing. Scam apps may succeed in draining wallets instead of swapping tokens.

**Test transactions**

- Before transacting using a large number of tokens, test the process with a small amount first. If something looks suspicious (e.g., unexpected approval requests), stop and verify before proceeding.`,

    question: 'Can I still vote and delegate with MKR?',
    answer: `No, MKR is no longer used for Sky Ecosystem Governance. Only SKY, the upgrade of MKR, can be used to participate in Sky Ecosystem Governance voting at the new [Sky Governance Voting Portal](https://vote.sky.money/).

**How to start voting using SKY**

- SKY holders can use the token to vote directly on Sky Ecosystem Governance proposals and/or to transfer the voting power of their SKY tokens to a recognized delegate or a contract that they own. If you are MKR holder who wishes to upgrade your MKR to SKY to vote, you would:

- Go to the Maker Governance Portal (https://vote.makerdao.com/) to remove your MKR from the old Chief contract or, if applicable, un-delegate your MKR from the delegate you've chosen to vote on your behalf.

- Go to the Sky.money web app (https://app.sky.money) to upgrade your MKR to SKY.

- Go to the Sky Governance Portal (https://vote.sky.money/) and:
  * **Approve your SKY.** Permit the new Chief contract to use your SKY tokens.
  * **Deposit SKY.** Lock your SKY tokens into the new Chief contract to activate your voting power or assign your voting power to a delegate of your choice or to a contract that you own.
