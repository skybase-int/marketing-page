## Sky Marketing Site

### Local set up

- Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- You'll need Node.js v18.16 or higher (some lower versions of v18 might also work too)
- Copy the `.env example` file into a `.env` file and set up the NPM token
- Install the packages: `pnpm install`
- Run locally: `pnpm dev`

### Environment Variables

To run the application locally, you need to set the following environment variables in your `.env` file:

- `NPM_TOKEN`: Your NPM token.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SKIP_AUTH_CHECK`: Set this to `true` for local development to bypass auth checks
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_TERMS_LINK`: Array containing links to terms of use
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FOOTER_LINKS`: Array containing links to show in the footer
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBAPP_URL`: The URL of the webapp
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_URL`: The URL of the auth service
- `API_URL`: The URL of the API service

You can find an example of how to set these in the `.env example` file.

### E2E tests

Running tests in headless mode:

```
pnpm playwright
//or
pnpm e2e //starts dev server first
```

Running tests in UI mode:

First make sure that the env var `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_WALLET=true` is set

Start the dev server locally:

```
pnpm dev
```

Then open the Playwright UI:

```
pnpm playwright --ui
```

or download the [Playwright VS Code extension](https://playwright.dev/docs/getting-started-vscode) and run the tests from VS Code, either headless or with the browser.

The VS code extension can also help with [generating tests](https://playwright.dev/docs/codegen)

to run the app locally with the mock wallet, run `pnpm dev:mock`. And to open a playwright browser to manaully test something, run `pnpm playwright:open`.
